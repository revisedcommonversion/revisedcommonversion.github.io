  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to perform, 2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. 3 And the LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before me. I have hallowed this house which you have built to put my name there forever. And my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. 4 And if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you and keep my statutes and my judgments, 5 Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom upon Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, 'There shall not fail you a man upon the throne of Israel.'</p>

  <p>6 "But if you at all turn from following me—you or your children—and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, 7 Then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this house which I have hallowed for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all people. 8 And at this house which is high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss. And they shall say, 'Why has the LORD done so to this land and to this house?' 9 And they shall answer, 'Because they forsook the LORD their God who brought forth their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshiped them and served them, therefore the LORD has brought all this evil upon them.'"</p>

  <p>10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house 11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold, according to all his desire), that king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him. 13 And he said, "What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?" And he called them the land of Cabul to this day. 14 And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</p>

  <p>15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised: to build the house of the LORD, his own house, Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, taken Gezer, burnt it with fire, slain the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife. 17 And Solomon built Gezer, Beth-horon the nether, 18 Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness in the land, 19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, cities for his chariots, cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 20 And all the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel, 21 Their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able to utterly destroy, upon those Solomon levied a tribute of bond-service to this day. 22 But Solomon did not make bond-men of the children of Israel, but they were men of war, his servants, his princes, his captains, rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>

  <p>23 These were the chief of the officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people who wrought in the work.</p>

  <p>24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he built Millo.</p>

  <p>25 And three times in a year Solomon offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p>

  <p>26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom. 27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 28 And they came to Ophir and imported from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>
