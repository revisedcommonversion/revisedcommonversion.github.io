  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, write for yourself the name of the day, even of this very day. The king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this very day. 3 And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Set on a pot, set it on,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also pour water into it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Gather its pieces into it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even every good piece,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the thigh and the shoulder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Fill it with the choice bones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Take the choice of the flock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also burn the bones under it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make it boil well,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let them boil its bones in it."</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Woe to the bloody city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the pot whose scum is therein,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose scum has not gone out of it!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bring it out piece by piece.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let no lot fall upon it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For her blood is in the midst of her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She set it upon the top of a rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She did not pour it upon the ground<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cover it with dust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> In order to cause fury to come up and to take vengeance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have set her blood upon the top of a rock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it should not be covered."</p>
  </div>

  <p>9 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Woe to the bloody city!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will even make the pile for fire great.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Heap on wood, kindle the fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />consume the flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />spice it well,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the bones be burned.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Then set it empty upon its coals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that its brass may be hot and may burn,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that its filthiness may be melted in it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that its scum may be consumed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> She has wearied herself with lies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her great scum did not go forth out of her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her scum shall be in the fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> In your filthiness is lewdness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because I have purged you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you were not purged,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall not be purged from your filthiness anymore<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I have caused my fury to rest upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "I, the LORD, have spoken it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall come to pass and I will do it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not go back, neither will I spare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will I repent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to your ways and according to your doings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall judge you,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD.'"</p>

  <p>15 Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 16 "Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke. Yet you shall not mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down. 17 Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the turban of your head upon you, put your shoes upon your feet, do not cover your lips, and do not eat the bread of men." 18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded. 19 And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things are to us that you are doing?" 20 Then I answered them, "The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 21 'Speak to the house of Israel, "Thus says the Lord GOD: 'Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellence of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities. And your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword. 22 And you shall do as I have done. You shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men. 23 And your turbans shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet. You shall not mourn nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn toward one another. 24 Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you. According to all that he has done you shall do. And when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.'"</p>

  <p>25 'Also, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, 26 That he who escapes in that day shall come to you to cause you to hear it with your ears? 27 In that day your mouth shall be opened to him who has escaped, and you shall speak and no longer be mute. And you shall be a sign to them. And they shall know that I am the LORD.'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the destruction of the city and temple of Jerusalem is prophesied of; the former under the parable of a boiling pot; the latter is represented by the sudden death of Ezekiel's wife. The time of this prophecy was that very day the king of Babylon began the siege of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 24:1-2); the parable of the boiling pot (Ezekiel 24:3-5); the explanation and application of it to the city of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 24:6-14); the prophet is told of the death of his wife and bid not to mourn on that account, which accordingly came to pass (Ezekiel 24:15-18); upon the people's inquiring what these things meant, he informs them that hereby was signified the profanation of the temple; and that their distress should be so great, that they should not use any set forms of mourning, but pine away and die (Ezekiel 24:19-24); and the chapter is closed with assuring the prophet that the day these things should come to pass, a messenger should be sent him, to whom he should open his mouth and be no more mute (Ezekiel 24:25-27).</p>
