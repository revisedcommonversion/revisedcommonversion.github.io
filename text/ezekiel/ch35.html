  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, set your face against mount Seir and prophesy against it,</p>

  <p>3 And say to it, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will stretch out my hand against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make you most desolate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I will lay your cities waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>5 "Because you have had a perpetual hatred and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end, 6 Therefore, as I live," says the Lord GOD, "I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, even blood shall pursue you. 7 Thus I will make mount Seir most desolate and cut off from it him who passes over and him who returns. 8 And I will fill his mountains with his slain men. In your hills, in your valleys, and in all your rivers, they shall fall who are slain with the sword. 9 I will make you perpetual desolations, and your cities shall not return. And you shall know that I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>10 "Because you have said, 'These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it,' whereas the LORD was there, 11 Therefore, as I live," says the Lord GOD, "I will even do according to your anger and according to your envy which you have used out of your hatred against them, and I will make myself known among them when I have judged you. 12 And you shall know that I am the LORD and that I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are laid desolate. They are given to us to consume.' 13 Thus with your mouth you have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me. I have heard them." 14 Thus says the Lord GOD: "When the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. 15 As you rejoiced at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You shall be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it. And they shall know that I am the LORD."'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter is a prophecy of the destruction of Edom, which is threatened (Ezekiel 35:1-4); the cause of it, their hatred and slaughter of the Israelites (Ezekiel 35:5-9); their claim of the lands of Israel and Judah for possession (Ezekiel 35:10-11); their blasphemies against the people of God and the Lord himself (Ezekiel 35:12-13); the aggravation of their ruin, which was irretrievable; that when it was well with others, it should go ill with them; by way of just retaliation (Ezekiel 35:14-15).</p>
