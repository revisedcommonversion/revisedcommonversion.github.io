  <p>1 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Because your heart is lifted up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have said, 'I am a god.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sit in the seat of God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the seas,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet you are a man and not God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though you set your heart as the heart of God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Behold, you are wiser than Daniel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no secret that they can hide from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> With your wisdom and with your understanding<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have gained riches for yourself<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have gained gold and silver<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into your treasures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> By your great wisdom and by your traffic<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have increased your riches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your heart is lifted up because of your riches."</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Because you have set your heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the heart of God,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Therefore behold, I will bring strangers upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the terrible of the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall draw their swords<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against the beauty of your wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall defile your brightness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They shall bring you down to the pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall die the deaths of those who are slain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the seas.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Will you yet say before him who slays you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I am God'?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you shall be a man and no god<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the hand of him who slays you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You shall die the deaths of the uncircumcised<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the hand of strangers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I have spoken it,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD.'"</p>

  <p>11 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12 "Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"You seal up the sum,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You have been in Eden the garden of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every precious stone was your covering:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sardius, topaz, the diamond,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the beryl, the onyx, the jasper,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle, and gold.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The workmanship of your tambourines and of your pipes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />was prepared in you in the day that you were created.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You are the anointed cherub who covers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have set you so.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You were upon the holy mountain of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have walked up and down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the stones of fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> You were perfect in your ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the day that you were created,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until iniquity was found in you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> By the multitude of your merchandise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have filled the midst of you with violence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have sinned;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I will cast you as profane<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of the mountain of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will destroy you, O covering cherub,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the midst of the stones of fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have corrupted your wisdom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by reason of your brightness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will cast you to the ground,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will lay you before kings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may behold you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> You have defiled your sanctuaries<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the multitude of your iniquities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the iniquity of your traffic;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I will bring forth a fire from the midst of you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall devour you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bring you to ashes upon the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the sight of all those who behold you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> All those who know you among the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be astonished at you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall be a terror<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and never shall you be anymore."'"</p>
  </div>

  <p>20 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 21 "Son of man, set your face against Zidon and prophesy against it, 22 And say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, I am against you, O Zidon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will be glorified in the midst of you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall know that I am the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I have executed judgments in her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have been sanctified in her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> For I will send into her pestilence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and blood into her streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the sword upon her on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 And there shall no more be a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all who are around them who despised them. And they shall know that I am the Lord GOD."</p>

  <p>25 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "When I have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered and have been sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, they shall dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 26 And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall even dwell with confidence when I have executed judgments upon all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am the LORD their God."'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains a prophecy of the destruction of the prince of Tyre; a lamentation for the king of Tyre; a denunciation of judgments on Zidon, and a promise of peace and safety to Israel. The order given to the prophet to prophesy of the ruin of the prince of Tyre (Ezekiel 28:1-2); the cause of his ruin, his pride on account of his wisdom and riches, which rose to such a pitch, as to make himself God (Ezekiel 28:2-6); the manner in which his destruction shall be accomplished (Ezekiel 28:7-10); the lamentation for the king of Tyre begins (Ezekiel 28:11-12); setting forth his former grandeur and dignity (Ezekiel 28:13-15); his fall, and the cause of it, injustice and violence in merchandise, pride because of beauty and wisdom, and profanation of sanctuaries (Ezekiel 28:16-19); next follow the judgments on Zidon (Ezekiel 28:20-23); and the chapter is concluded with a promise of the restoration of the Jews to their own land, and of great tranquillity and safety in it (Ezekiel 28:24-26).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "the prince of Tyre" - From John Gill's Exposition: "Whose name was Ethbaal, or Ithobalus, as he is called in Josephus; for that this was Hiram that was in the days of Solomon, and lived a thousand years, is a fable of the Jewish Rabbins, as Jerom relates: this prince of Tyre is thought by some to be an emblem of the devil; but rather of antichrist; and between them there is a great agreement, and it seems to have a prophetic respect to him."</p>
