  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, 'Aha! She who was the gates of the people is broken. She has turned to me. I shall be replenished. Now she is laid waste,' 3 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: 'Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up. 4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers. I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock. 5 It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea. For I have spoken it,' says the Lord GOD, 'and it shall become plunder to the nations. 6 And her daughters who are in the field shall be slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am the LORD.'"</p>

  <p>7 For thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, upon Tyre I will bring Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north with horses, with chariots, with horsemen, companies, and many people. 8 He shall slay your daughters in the field with the sword. And he shall make a fort against you, cast a siege-mound against you, and lift up the buckler against you. 9 And he shall set battering rams of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers. 10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you. Your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, of the wheels, and of the chariots when he enters into your gates, as men enter into a city in which a breach is made. 11 With the hooves of his horses he shall tread down all your streets. He shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. 12 And they shall make loot of your riches and make plunder of your merchandise. And they shall break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses. And they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the water. 13 And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease, and the sound of your harps shall no longer be heard. 14 And I will make you like the top of a rock. You shall be a place to spread nets upon. You shall be built no more. For I, the LORD, have spoken it," says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p>15 Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: "Shall the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you? 16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, lay away their robes, and take off their embroidered garments. They shall clothe themselves with trembling. They shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at you.</p>

  <p>17 And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, 'How you are destroyed, who were inhabited by sea-faring men, the renowned city, which was strong in the sea—she and her inhabitants—who cause their terror to be on all who dwelt there!</p>

  <p>18 Now the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall. Even the coastlands that are by the sea shall be disturbed at your departure.'"</p>

  <p>19 For thus says the Lord GOD: "When I make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep upon you and great waters shall cover you, 20 When I bring you down with those who descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and set you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, so that you are not inhabited, but I shall set glory in the land of the living, 21 I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more. Though you shall be sought for, yet you shall never be found again," says the Lord GOD.</p>
