  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'You are like a young lion of the nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you are as a dragon in the seas.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you came forth with your rivers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and disturbed the waters with your feet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rendered their rivers foul.'"</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"I will therefore spread out my net over you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a company of many people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall bring you up in my net.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Then I will leave you upon the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will cast you forth upon the open field.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will cause all the birds of the heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to remain upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And I will lay your flesh upon the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fill the valleys with your height.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I will also water with your blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the land in which you swim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to the mountains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the rivers shall be full of you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And when I extinguish you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will cover the heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make the stars thereof dark.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will cover the sun with a cloud<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the moon shall not give her light.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> All the bright lights of heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make dark over you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set darkness upon your land,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p>9 "I will also vex the hearts of many people when I bring your destruction among the nations into the countries which you have not known. 10 Indeed, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you when I brandish my sword before them. And they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall."</p>

  <p>11 For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The sword of the king of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall come upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> By the swords of the mighty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will cause your multitude to fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the terrible of the nations, all of them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall lay the pomp of Egypt to waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all its multitude shall be destroyed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> I will also destroy all its beasts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from beside the great waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the foot of man disturb them anymore,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the hooves of beasts disturb them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Then I will make their waters deep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cause their rivers to run like oil,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> "When I make the land of Egypt desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the country is destitute of that of which it was full,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I smite all those who dwell in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> "This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The daughters of the nations shall lament her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall lament for her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even for Egypt and for all her multitude,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p>17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18 "Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the nether parts of the earth with those who go down into the pit.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> 'Whom do you pass in beauty?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.'</p>
  </div>

  <p>20 "They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her and all her multitudes. 21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of the grave with those who help him, 'They have gone down. They lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.'</p>

  <p>22 "Asshur is there and all her company. His graves are around him. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, 23 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.</p>

  <p>24 "There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. 25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around him. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword. Though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put in the midst of those who are slain.</p>

  <p>26 "There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude. Her graves are around him. All of them are uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living. 27 And they shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to the grave with their weapons of war. And they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. 28 Indeed, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shall lie with those who are slain with the sword.</p>

  <p>29 "There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who with their might are laid by those who were slain by the sword. They shall lie with the uncircumcised and with those who go down to the pit.</p>

  <p>30 "There are the princes of the north—all of them and all the Zidonians—who have gone down with the slain. With their terror they are ashamed of their might, and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.</p>

  <p>31 "Pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword," says the Lord GOD. 32 "For I have caused my terror in the land of the living. And he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those who are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude," says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains two more prophecies concerning the destruction of Egypt. The date of the first is given (Ezekiel 22:1); in which the king of Egypt is compared to a large fish taken in a net, brought to land, and left on it to be the prey of the fowls of the air and beasts of the field (Ezekiel 32:2-4); and the ruin of that kingdom is further amplified by the casting of it on the mountains and valleys; by the land flowing with its blood; by the darkness of the heavens; by the vexation in the hearts of many people; and by the amazement of kings and nations (Ezekiel 32:5-10); the means and instruments of all which will be the king of Babylon and his army (Ezekiel 32:11-12); the devastation made by him, which would be such as would cause lamentation in other nations, is described (Ezekiel 32:13-16); then follows the other prophecy, whose date is given (Ezekiel 32:17); the prophet is bid to lament the fall of Egypt, which is represented under the funeral of a corpse (Ezekiel 32:18-20); saluted by those gone down to the grave before, or were become desolate; which are mentioned, to assure Egypt of its destruction (Ezekiel 32:21); as the Assyrian empire and all its provinces (Ezekiel 32:22-23); the Persians and Medes, with all their dominions (Ezekiel 32:24-25); the posterity of Meshech and Tubal, or the Scythians, those warlike people (Ezekiel 32:26-28); the Edomites, the princes of the north, and all the Zidonians (Ezekiel 32:29-30); which would be a comfort, though a poor one to the king of Egypt and his subjects to have such company with them (Ezekiel 32:31-32).</p>
