  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, on that same day the hand of the LORD was upon me and brought me there. 2 In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south. 3 And he brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed, and he stood in the gate. 4 And the man said to me, "Son of man, behold with your eyes and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for, to the intent that I might show them to you, you are brought here. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel."</p>

  <p>5 And behold a wall on the outside of the house around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and a hand-breadth. So he measured the breadth of the building, one reed, and the height, one reed. 6 Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east and ascended its stairs. And he measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad, and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad. 7 And every little chamber was one reed long and one reed broad. And between the little chambers were five cubits. And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed. 8 He also measured the porch of the gate within, one reed. 9 Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its posts, two cubits, and the porch of the gate was inward. 10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. And the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 11 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 12 Also the space before the little chambers was one cubit on this side and the space was one cubit on that side. And the little chambers were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side. 13 He then measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another. The breadth was twenty-five cubits, door against door. 14 He also made posts of sixty cubits, even to the post of the court around the gate. 15 And from the face of the gate of the entrance to the face of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits. 16 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers and to their posts within the gate around, and likewise to the arches. And windows were around inward. And upon each post were palm-trees.</p>

  <p>17 Then he brought me into the outward court, and behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court around. Thirty chambers were upon the pavement. 18 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement. 19 Then he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits eastward and northward.</p>

  <p>20 And he measured the length and the breadth of the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north. 21 And its little chambers were three on this side and three on that side. And its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate. Its length was fifty cubits and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 22 And their windows, their arches, and their palm-trees were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east. And they went up to it by seven steps, and its arches were before them. 23 And there was a gate in the inner court over against the gate toward the north, just like the one toward the east. And he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.</p>

  <p>24 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south. And he measured its posts and its arches according to these measures. 25 And there were windows in it and in its arches around, like those windows. The length was fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits. 26 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them. And it had palm-trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon its posts. 27 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south. And he measured from gate to gate toward the south one hundred cubits.</p>

  <p>28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate. And he measured the south gate according to these measures, 29 And also its little chambers, its posts, and its arches according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in its arches around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad. 30 And the arches around were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad. 31 And its arches were toward the outer court. And palm-trees were upon its posts. And the ascent to it had eight steps.</p>

  <p>32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east. And he measured the gate according to these measures, 33 And also its little chambers, its posts, and its arches according to these measures. And there were windows in it and in its arches around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad. 34 And its arches were toward the outward court. And palm-trees were upon its posts on this side and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.</p>

  <p>35 And he brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these measures, 36 And also its little chambers, its posts, its arches, and the windows to it around. The length was fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits. 37 And its posts were toward the outer court. And palm-trees were upon its posts on this side and on that side. And the ascent to it had eight steps.</p>

  <p>38 And the chambers and its entries were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt-offering. 39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, upon which to slay the burnt-offering, the sin-offering, and the trespass-offering. 40 And at the side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. 41 Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side by the side of the gate—eight tables upon which they slew their sacrifices. 42 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt-offering, of a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, upon which they also laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice. 43 And within were hooks, a hand broad, fastened around. And upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</p>

  <p>44 And outside the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court. One was at the side of the north gate and its prospect was toward the south, the other at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. 45 And he said to me, "This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 46 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, who come near to the LORD to minister to him." 47 So he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits broad, square, and also the altar that was before the house.</p>

  <p>48 And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side. And the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the breadth eleven cubits. And he brought me by the steps by which they went up to it. And there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.</p>
