  <p>1 The word of the LORD came to me again, saying, 2 "Now, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre,</p>

  <p>3 And say to Tyre, who is situated at the entry of the sea, who is a merchant of the people for many coastlands, 'Thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"O Tyre, you have said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I am of perfect beauty.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Your borders are in the midst of the seas.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your builders have perfected your beauty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They have made all your ship-boards<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of fir-trees of Senir.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have taken cedars from Lebanon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make masts for you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Of the oaks of Bashan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have made your oars.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The company of the Ashurites have made your benches of ivory,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />brought out of the coastlands of Chittim.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />was that which you spread forth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to be your sail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blue and purple from the coastlands of Elishah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />was that which covered you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />were your mariners.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your wise men, O Tyre, who were in you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />were your pilots.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The ancients of Gebal and its wise men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />were in you as your caulkers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to occupy your merchandise.</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 "They of Persia, of Lud, and of Phut were in your army, your military men. They hung the shield and helmet in you. They set forth your splendor. 11 The men of Arvad with your army were upon your walls on all sides, and the Gammadims were in your towers. They hung their shields upon your walls on every side. They have made your beauty perfect.</p>

  <p>12 "Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches. With silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs. 13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants. They traded in the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market. 14 They of the house of Togarmah traded in your fairs with horses, horsemen, and mules. 15 The men of Dedan were your merchants. Many coastlands were the merchandise of your hand. They brought you in exchange horns of ivory and ebony. 16 Syria was your merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of your making. They occupied in your fairs with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and agate. 17 Judah, and the land of Israel, they were your merchants. They traded in your market in wheat of Minnith, Pannag, honey, oil, and balm. 18 Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches, in the wine of Helbon and white wool. 19 Dan and also Javan going to and fro occupied in your fairs. Bright iron, cassia, and calamus were in your market. 20 Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 21 Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with you in lambs, rams, and goats. In these they were your merchants. 22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants. They occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, with all precious stones and gold. 23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad were your merchants. 24 These were your merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, embroidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> "The ships of Tarshish sang of you in your market.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you were replenished and made very glorious<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the seas.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> And shall cause their voice to be heard against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall cry bitterly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall cast up dust upon their heads.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall wallow themselves in the ashes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> And they shall make themselves utterly bald for you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gird themselves with sackcloth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall weep for you with bitterness of heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bitter wailing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lament over you, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'What city is like Tyre, like the destroyed one<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the sea?</p>
