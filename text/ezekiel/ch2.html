  <p>1 And he said to me, "Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak to you." 2 And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me and set me upon my feet, so that I heard him who spoke to me. 3 And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day, 4 For they are impudent children and obstinate in heart. I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' 5 And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them. 6 And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, even though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.</p>

  <p>8 "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat that which I give you." 9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it, 10 And he spread it before me. And it was written inside and outside. And there was written in it lamentations, mourning, and woe.</p>
