  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And he said to me, "Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak to you." 2 And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me and set me upon my feet, so that I heard him who spoke to me. 3 And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day, 4 For they are impudent children and obstinate in heart. I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' 5 And they, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them. 6 And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, even though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.</p>

  <p>8 "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat that which I give you." 9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was sent to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it, 10 And he spread it before me. And it was written inside and outside. And there was written in it lamentations, mourning, and woe.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the prophet's call, commission, and instruction to prophesy. The preparation for it (Ezekiel 2:1-2); having fallen upon his face, he is bid to stand upon his feet, with a promise to speak to him, and the Spirit entering into him, he is set by him on his feet, and he hears what is spoken to him, then follows his mission to the children of Israel, who are described as rebellious, impudent, and stiff-hearted, and to whom he is sent to render them inexcusable (Ezekiel 2:3-5); and he is exhorted not to be afraid of their words, nor dismayed at their looks, however fierce and furious they might be, but faithfully declare his message and not be discouraged, should it be without success (Ezekiel 2:6-7); and he is instructed not to be rebellious as they were, but open his mouth and eat what should be given to him (Ezekiel 2:8); then, in a visionary way, a hand was seen and a roll in it, and this spread before him written on the inside and outside, full of lamentation, mourning, and woes, as a symbol of the substance of his prophecy (Ezekiel 2:9-10).</p>
