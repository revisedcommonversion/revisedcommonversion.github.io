  <p>1 "Moreover, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 2 And say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'What is your mother? A lioness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She lay down among lions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She nourished her whelps<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among young lions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And she brought up one of her whelps.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It became a young lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it learned to catch prey.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It devoured men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The nations also heard of him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He was taken in their pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they brought him with chains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the land of Egypt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Now when she saw that she had waited<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her hope was lost,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she took another of her whelps<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made him a young lion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And he went up and down among the lions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He became a young lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and learned to catch prey.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He devoured men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And he knew their desolate palaces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he laid waste their cities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the land and its fullness was desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the noise of his roaring.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Then the nations set against him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on every side from the provinces<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and spread their net over him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He was taken in their pit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And they put him in a cage with hooks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brought him to the king of Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They brought him into holds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that his voice should no longer be heard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the mountains of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Your mother is like a vine in your blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />planted by the waters.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She was fruitful and full of branches<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by reason of many waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And she had strong branches<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the scepters of those who bore rule,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her stature was exalted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among the thick branches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she appeared in her height<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the multitude of her branches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> But she was plucked up in fury,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she was cast down to the ground,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the east wind dried up her fruit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her strong rods were broken and withered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The fire consumed them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And now she is planted in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in a dry and thirsty ground.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And fire has gone out of a rod of her branches.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It has devoured her fruit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that she has no strong rod<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to be a scepter to rule.'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The subject matter of this chapter is a lamentation for the princes and people of the Jews, on account of what had already befallen them and what was yet to come (Ezekiel 19:1). The mother of the princes is compared to a lioness, and they to lions, who, one after another, were taken and carried captive (Ezekiel 19:2-9); again, their mother is compared to a vine, and they to branches and rods for sceptres, destroyed by an east wind and consumed by fire (Ezekiel 19:10-14).</p>
