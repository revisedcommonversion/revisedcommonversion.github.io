  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Afterward, he brought me to the temple and measured the posts, six cubits broad on one side and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. 2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits. And the sides of the door were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. And he measured its length, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits. 3 Then he went inward and measured the post of the door, two cubits, and the door, six cubits, and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. 4 So he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple. And he said to me, "This is the holy of holies."</p>

  <p>5 Afterward, he measured the wall of the house, six cubits, and the breadth of every side-chamber, four cubits, around the house on every side. 6 And the side-chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order, and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side-chambers around, so that they might be attached, but they were not attached to the wall of the house. 7 And the side-chambers broadened, winding around upward, for the winding around of the house conveyed upward around the house. Therefore, the breadth of the house continued upward, and thus one ascends from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle. 8 I also saw the height of the house around. The foundations of the side-chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. 9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side-chamber outside, was five cubits. And that which was left was the place of the side-chambers that were inside. 10 And between the chambers was the width of twenty cubits around the house on every side. 11 And the doors of the side-chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north and another door toward the south. And the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits around.</p>

  <p>12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad. And the wall of the building was five cubits thick around, and its length ninety cubits.</p>

  <p>13 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long, and the separate place and the building with its walls, one hundred cubits long, 14 Also the breadth of the face of the house and of the separate place toward the east, one hundred cubits.</p>

  <p>15 And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it and its galleries on one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits. The inner temple and the porches of the court, 16 The door posts and the narrow windows, and the galleries around on their three stories, over against the door, were ceiled with wood around, and from the ground up to the windows (and the windows were covered), 17 To the space above the door, even to the inner house and on the outside, and by all the wall around inside and outside, by measure. 18 And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees, so that a palm-tree was between a cherub and a cherub. And every cherub had two faces, 19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm-tree on one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side. It was made through all the house around. 20 From the ground to above the door, cherubim and palm-trees were made, as well as on the wall of the temple.</p>

  <p>21 As for the temple, the door-posts were squared. And as for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple. 22 The altar of wood was three cubits high and its length two cubits, and its corners, its length, and its walls were of wood. And he said to me, "This is the table that is before the LORD." 23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. 24 And the doors had two leaves each, two turning leaves: two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other door. 25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm-trees, as were made upon the walls. And there were thick planks upon the face of the porch outside. 26 And there were narrow windows and palm-trees on one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, the side-chambers of the house, and the thick planks.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the divine and illustrious Person, the prophet's guide, brings him to the temple itself and gives the dimensions of the posts and doors, both of the holy and the most holy place (Ezekiel 41:1-4); then of the wall of the house, its side chambers, the winding about to them, and the doors of them (Ezekiel 41:5-11); next of a building before the separate place, its doorposts, narrow windows, and galleries (Ezekiel 41:12-17); after that each of the ornaments of the house are described (Ezekiel 41:18-21); then the altar of incense (Ezekiel 41:22); and the chapter is concluded with observing the decorations and lights on the doors, porch, and side chambers of the temple and sanctuary (Ezekiel 41:23-26).</p>
