  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, 2 And caused me to pass by them around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley, and behold, they were very dry. 3 And he said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, you know." 4 Again he said to me, "Prophesy upon these bones, and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. 6 And I will lay sinews upon you, bring up flesh upon you, cover you with skin, put breath in you, and you shall live. And you shall know that I am the LORD."'"</p>

  <p>7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 8 And when I beheld, behold, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above, but there was no breath in them. 9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, so that they may live."'" 10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood up upon their feet—an exceedingly great army.</p>

  <p>11 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, 'Our bones are dried and our hope is lost. We are cut off for our parts.' 12 Therefore, prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, O my people, I will open your graves and cause you to come out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel. 13 And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you out of your graves. 14 And I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken it and performed it," says the LORD.'"</p>

  <p>15 The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 16 "Moreover, son of man, take one stick and write upon it, 'For Judah and for the children of Israel his companions.' Then take another stick and write upon it, 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions.' 17 And join them to one another into one stick, and they shall become one in your hand. 18 And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, 'Will you not show us what you mean by these?' 19 Say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph—which is in the hand of Ephraim—and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and I will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah. And I will make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand."' 20 And the sticks on which you write shall be in your hand before their eyes. 21 And say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen where they have gone and gather them on every side and bring them into their own land. 22 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king to them all. And they shall no longer be two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms anymore at all, 23 Neither shall they defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions. But I will save them out of all their dwelling-places in which they have sinned and cleanse them. So they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>

  <p>24 "And David my servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes, and do them. 25 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell in it—even they, their children, and their children's children forever. And my servant David shall be their prince forever. 26 Moreover, I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them and set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore. 27 My tabernacle shall also be with them. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 28 And the heathen shall know that I, the LORD, sanctify Israel when my sanctuary is in the midst of them forever."'"</p>
