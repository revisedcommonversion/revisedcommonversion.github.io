  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east-gate of the LORD'S house, which looks eastward. And behold, at the door of the gate twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 2 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city, 3 Who say, 'It is not near. Let us build houses. This city is the cauldron, and we are the flesh.' 4 Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, O son of man."</p>

  <p>5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said to me, "Speak, 'Thus says the LORD: "Thus you have said, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mindâ€”every one of them. 6 You have multiplied your slain in this city and have filled its streets with the slain." 7 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: "Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the cauldron, but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 8 You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you," says the Lord GOD. 9 "And I will bring you out of the midst of it, deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments among you. 10 You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. And you shall know that I am the LORD. 11 This city shall not be your cauldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst of it. But I will judge you in the border of Israel. 12 And you shall know that I am the LORD, for you have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen who are around you."'"</p>

  <p>13 And it came to pass when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"</p>

  <p>14 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 15 "Son of man, your brothers, even your brothers, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'Retire far from the LORD. This land is given to us in possession.' 16 Therefore, say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come."' 17 Therefore, say, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel."' 18 And they shall come there and take away all its detestable things and all its abominations. 19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. And I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, 20 So that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances, and do them. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 21 But as for those whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads," says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p>22 Then the cherubim raised their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. 24 Afterward, the Spirit took me up and brought me in vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those who are in captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 25 Then I spoke to those who are in captivity all the things that the LORD had shown me.</p>
