  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel." 2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that scroll. 3 And he said to me, "Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this scroll that I give you." Then I ate it. And it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>

  <p>4 And he said to me, "Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them. 5 For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel, 6 Nor to many people of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you. 7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you, because they will not listen to me, for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted. 8 Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces and your forehead strong against their foreheads. 9 As an adamant harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house." 10 Moreover, he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart and hear with your ears. 11 And depart, go to those who are in captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD,' whether they will hear or whether they will forbear."</p>

  <p>12 Then the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, "Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place." 13 I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and the noise of a great rushing. 14 So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. 15 Then I came to those who were in captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river of Kebar, and I sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>

  <p>16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 17 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel; therefore, hear the word from my mouth and give them warning from me. 18 When I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. 19 Yet if you warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. 20 Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die. Because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered, but his blood I will require at your hand. 21 Nevertheless, if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous are not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned. You have also delivered your soul."</p>

  <p>22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me, and he said to me, "Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you." 23 Then I arose and went forth into the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Kebar. And I fell on my face. 24 Then the Spirit entered into me, set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house. 25 But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put ropes upon you and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them. 26 And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and shall not be to them a reprover, for they are a rebellious house. 27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD.' He who hears, let him hear, and he who forbears, let him forbear, for they are a rebellious house."</p>
