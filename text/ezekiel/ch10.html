  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them something like a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 2 And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, "Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim and scatter them over the city." And he entered in my sight.</p>

  <p>3 Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. 4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory. 5 And the sound of the cherubim's wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.</p>

  <p>6 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, "Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside the wheels. 7 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, took of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed with linen, who took it and went out. 8 And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p>

  <p>9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone. 10 And as for their appearances, the four of them had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 11 When they went, they went upon their four sides. They did not turn as they went. But to the place where the head looked, they followed it. They did not turn as they went. 12 And their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes on every side, even the wheels that the four of them had. 13 As for the wheels, it was cried to them in my hearing, "O wheel." 14 And each had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>

  <p>15 And the cherubim were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Kebar. 16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went by them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them. 17 When they stood, these stood, and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</p>

  <p>18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim. 19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels also were beside them. And each stood at the door of the east-gate of the LORD'S house, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</p>

  <p>20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Kebar, and I knew that they were the cherubim. 21 Each had four faces and each four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. 22 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Kebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter is a vision, very much like that in the first chapter, with some difference and with a different view, the design of it being to represent the wrath of God against Jerusalem and his departure from the city and temple. A throne much like that in Ezekiel 1:26 is described (Ezekiel 10:1); orders are given from it to scatter coals over the city (Ezekiel 10:2); the situation of the cherubim when these orders were given (Ezekiel 10:3); the removal of the glory of the Lord from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the consequences of it; the house filled with smoke, the court with the brightness of the Lord's glory, and the sound of the cherubim's wings heard to the outer court, as the voice of God (Ezekiel 10:4-5); the orders of taking and scattering fire over the city executed, and the manner in which they were (Ezekiel 10:6-7); a description of the cherubim and the wheels, much like that in the first chapter (Ezekiel 10:8-17); the departure of the glory of God from the threshold to the east gate of the Lord's house, with the motion of the cherubim and wheels along with him (Ezekiel 10:18-19); and the chapter is concluded with observing that the cherubim are the same with the living creatures seen in the vision of the first chapter and had the same form, likeness, and motion (Ezekiel 10:20-22).</p>
