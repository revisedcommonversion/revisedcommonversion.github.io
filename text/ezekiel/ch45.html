  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "'"Moreover, when you divide by lot the land for inheritance, you shall offer an oblation to the LORD, a holy portion of the land. The length shall be the length of twenty-five thousand reeds and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all its borders on every side. 2 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square around, and fifty cubits around for its suburbs. 3 And of this measure you shall measure the length of twenty-five thousand and the breadth of ten thousand. And in it shall be the sanctuary and the holy of holies. 4 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, who shall come near to minister to the LORD. And it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 5 And the twenty-five thousand of length and the ten thousand of breadth, the Levites, the ministers of the house, shall also have for themselves for a possession for twenty chambers.</p>

  <p>6 "And you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad and twenty-five thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion. It shall be for the whole house of Israel.</p>

  <p>7 "And a portion shall be for the prince on one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward and from the east side eastward. And the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border to the east border. 8 In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel. And my princes shall no longer oppress my people. And the rest of the land they shall give to the house of Israel according to their tribes."</p>

  <p>9 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel. Remove violence and plunder, and execute judgment and justice. Take away your exactions from my people," says the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p>10 "You shall have just balances, a just ephah and a just bath. 11 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, so that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer and the ephah the tenth part of a homer. Its measure shall be after the homer. 12 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.</p>

  <p>13 "This is the oblation that you shall offer: the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of wheat, and you shall give the sixth part of an ephah of a homer of barley; 14 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, you shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is a homer of ten baths (for ten baths are a homer); 15 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel, for a food-offering, for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make reconciliation for them," says the Lord GOD. 16 "All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel. 17 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt-offerings, food-offerings, and drink-offerings in the feasts, in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin-offering, the food-offering, the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings to make reconciliation for the house of Israel."</p>

  <p>18 'Thus says the Lord GOD: "In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish and cleanse the sanctuary. 19 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering and put it upon the posts of the house, upon the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 20 And thus you shall do the seventh day of the month for everyone who errs and for him who is simple. Thus you shall reconcile the house.</p>

  <p>21 "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall have the passover, a feast of seven days. Unleavened bread shall be eaten. 22 And upon that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin-offering. 23 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt-offering to the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days and a kid of the goats daily for a sin-offering. 24 And he shall prepare a food-offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil for an ephah. 25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, he shall do the same in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin-offering, according to the burnt-offering, according to the food-offering, and according to the oil."'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter treats of the division of the land in future time and the persons and uses for which it is to be made; one part being for the sanctuary and the priests that serve in it, and for their houses for them to dwell in (Ezekiel 45:1-4); another for the Levites and their chambers (Ezekiel 45:5); and another for the city, for the Israelites in common (Ezekiel 45:6); and the last for the prince; and of the situation and extent of it (Ezekiel 45:7-8); and of the righteous administration of civil government in the time of the spiritual reign of Christ, in abstinence from violence and exactions, and doing justice, for which orders and directions are given (Ezekiel 45:9-12); then of the oblations of the people of the land (Ezekiel 45:13-16); and next of those that are to be prepared by the prince (Ezekiel 45:17); and the times of the offering of them, at the beginning of the year, on the feasts of the passover and tabernacles (Ezekiel 45:18-25); the rules for which are so different from the Mosaic law, as show the abrogation of that; and that all this is to be understood in a spiritual and evangelic sense.</p>
