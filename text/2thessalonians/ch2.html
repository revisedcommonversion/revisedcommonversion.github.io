  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now we implore you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering to him, 2 That you not be soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, by word, nor by letter as from us, saying that the day of Christ is at hand. 3 Let no man deceive you by any means. For that day shall not come unless the falling away comes first and that man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, 4 Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped, so that he, as God, sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. 5 Do you not remember that when I was yet with you I told you these things? 6 And now you know that which restrains, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season. 7 For the mystery of iniquity already works. Only he who now restrains will restrain until he is taken out of the way. 8 And then that Wicked One is revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the spirit of his mouth and will destroy with the brightness of his coming, 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power, signs, and lying wonders, 10 And with all deceitfulness of unrighteousness in those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth so that they might be saved. 11 And for this cause God will send them strong delusion so that they should believe a lie, 12 So that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
  
  <p>13 But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers, beloved by the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, 14 To which he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</p>
  
  <p>16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 17 Comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.</p>
