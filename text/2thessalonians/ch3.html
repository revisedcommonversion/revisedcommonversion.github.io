  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it is with you, 2 And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, for all men do not have faith. 3 But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and keep you from evil. 4 And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things which we command you. 5 And may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ.</p>
  
  <p>6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks disorderly and not after the tradition which he received from us. 7 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us. For we did not behave ourselves disorderly among you, 8 Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but wrought with labor and toil night and day so that we might not be chargeable to any of you, 9 Not because we do not have power, but to make ourselves a pattern to you to follow us. 10 For even when we were with you, this we commanded you: that if any would not work, neither should he eat. 11 For we hear that there are some who walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but are busy-bodies. 12 Now those who are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that they work with quietness and eat their own bread. 13 But you, brothers, do not be weary in well-doing.</p>
  
  <p>14 And if any man does not obey our word by this epistle, note that man and have no company with him so that he may be ashamed. 15 Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
  
  <p>16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. May the Lord be with you all.</p>
  
  <p>17 The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every epistle. Thus I write. 18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
