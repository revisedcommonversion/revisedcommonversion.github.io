  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth an offensive odor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so does a little folly to him who is in reputation for wisdom and honor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> A wise man's heart is at his right hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a fool's heart is at his left.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Also, when he who is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> If the spirit of the ruler rises against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not leave your place,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for yielding pacifies great offenses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as an error which proceeds from the ruler:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Folly is set in great dignity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rich sit in a low place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> I have seen servants upon horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He who digs a pit shall fall into it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whoever breaks a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Whoever removes stones shall be hurt by them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who cleaves wood shall be endangered by it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> If the iron is blunt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he does not whet the edge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then he must use more strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But wisdom has the advantage to give success.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a babbler is no better.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> A fool is also full of words.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A man cannot tell what shall be.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what shall be after him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who can tell him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he does not know how to go to the city.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your princes eat in the morning!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> You are blessed, O land, when your king is the son of nobles,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your princes eat in due season—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for strength and not for drunkenness!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> By much slothfulness the building decays,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> A feast is made for laughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wine makes merry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but money answers all things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not curse the rich in your bed-chamber,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a bird of the air will carry the voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which has wings will tell the matter.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/ecclesiastes/MHC%20-%20Ecclesiastes%2C%20Chapter%2010.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.14a] - "A man cannot tell what shall be" - That is to say, a man cannot discern what is to come to pass, or he cannot say with certainty what the future will hold.</p>
  <p>[v.14b] - "And what shall be after him, who can tell him?" - If this is reworded as a statement, rather than a question, the thought behind this phrase would be this: "No one is able to tell a man what is to come to pass" In other words, no one is able to tell anyone what the future will hold. This knowledge is only possessed by God alone.</p>
