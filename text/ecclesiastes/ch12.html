    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />while the evil days do not come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the years draw near, when you shall say<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I have no pleasure in them";</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> While the sun, the light, the moon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the stars are not darkened,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the clouds return after the rain;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> In the day when the keepers of the house tremble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the strong men bow themselves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the grinders cease because they are few,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who look out of the windows are darkened,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And the doors are shut in the streets;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the sound of the grinding is low,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> When they are afraid of that which is high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fears are in the way;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the almond tree flourishes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the locust is a burden,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and desire fails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For man goes to his eternal home,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the mourners go throughout the streets.</p>

  <p>8 "Vanity of vanities," says the preacher. "All is vanity."</p>

  <p>9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. He even gave good heed, sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words. And that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>

  <p>11 The words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd. 12 And further, my son, be admonished by these: of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>

  <p>13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. 14 For God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</p>
