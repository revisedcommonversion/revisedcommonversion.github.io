  <p>1 [<span class="it">The words of the preacher, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Vanity of vanities," says the preacher.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Vanity of vanities. All is vanity."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> What profit does a man have of all his labor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which he takes under the sun?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> One generation passes away and another generation comes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the earth abides forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The sun also rises,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the sun goes down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hastens to his place where he arose.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The wind goes toward the south<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and turns around to the north.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It whirls around continually,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wind returns again according to its circuits.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All the rivers run into the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet the sea is not full.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To the place from where the rivers come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there they return again.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> All things are full of labor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Man cannot utter it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The eye is not satisfied with seeing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The thing that has been, is that which shall be.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And that which is done, is that which shall be done.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Is there anything of which it may be said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"See, this is new"?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It has already existed long ago,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which was before us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> There is no remembrance of former things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall there be any remembrance<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of things that are to come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with those that shall come after.</p>

  <p>12 I, the preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven. This is a grievous labor that God has given to the sons of man to be exercised with. 14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. 15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight. And that which is lacking cannot be numbered.</p>

  <p>16 I spoke with my own heart, saying, "Behold, I have come to great estate and have gained more wisdom than all those who have been before me in Jerusalem, and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge." 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 18 For in much wisdom is much grief. And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
