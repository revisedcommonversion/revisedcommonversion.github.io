  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered into the temple. 3 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. 4 And Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, "Look at us." 5 And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something from them. 6 Then Peter said, "I do not have silver and gold, but what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk." 7 And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up. And immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. 8 And leaping up, he stood, walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God. 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 10 And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</p>

  <p>11 And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. 12 And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why do you look so earnestly at us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? 13 The God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. 14 But you denied the Holy and Just One and desired a murderer to be granted to you, 15 And killed the Prince of life whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. 16 And through faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Indeed, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</p>

  <p>17 "And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as your rulers also did. 18 But those things which God before had shown by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has thus fulfilled. 19 Therefore, repent and be converted so that your sins may be blotted out, and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 20 And that he may send Jesus Christ, who before was preached to you, 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. 22 For Moses truly said to the fathers, '<cite>The Lord your God will raise a Prophet up to you, of your brothers, like me. You shall hear him in all things, whatever he says to you.</cite> 23 <cite>And it shall come to pass, that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</cite>' 24 And all the prophets also from Samuel, and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days. 25 You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, '<cite>And in your seed all the kindreds of the earth shall be blessed.</cite>' 26 God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to you first to bless you in turning away each of you from his iniquities."</p>
