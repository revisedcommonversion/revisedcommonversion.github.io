    <p class="ch-outline">Paul labors with his hands and preaches at Corinth to the Gentiles, 1-8. The Lord encourages him in a vision, 9-11.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After these things, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth, 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), and he came to them. 3 And because he was of the same occupation, he stayed with them and worked (for by their occupation they were tent-makers), 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>

  <p>5 And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. 6 And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his clothing and said to them, "May your blood be upon your own heads. I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 7 And he departed from there and entered into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house joined close to the synagogue. 8 And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house. And many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized. 9 Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision: "<span class="woc">Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not hold your peace.</span> 10 <span class="woc">For I am with you and no man shall lay hands on you to hurt you, for I have many people in this city.</span>" 11 And he continued there one year and six months teaching the word of God among them.</p>

  <p>12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgment-seat, 13 Saying, "This man persuades men to worship God contrary to the law." 14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrong, or heinous crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable that I should bear with you. 15 But if it is a question of words and names and of your law, you look to it, for I will be no judge of such matters." 16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat. 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>

  <p>18 And Paul, after this, remained there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brothers and sailed from there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow. 19 And he came to Ephesus and left them there. But he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. 20 When they desired him to stay for a longer time with them, he did not consent, 21 But bid them farewell, saying, "I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem. But I will return to you, if God wills." And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>

  <p>22 And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>

  <p>23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>

  <p>24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. 25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and diligently taught the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly. 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brothers wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he helped them much who had believed through grace. 28 For he mightily convinced the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/acts/MHC%20-%20Acts%2C%20Chapter%2018.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Acts, Chapter 18</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.18] - "He shaved" - This is most likely referring to Paul. Some sources say this applies to Aquila and some to Priscilla and Aquila, but Paul is most likely referred to here. From John Gill's Exposition: "the more authentic reading is in the singular number, and is more generally understood of the Apostle Paul; who being about to go into Judea, to the Jews became a Jew, that he might gain some."</p>
