  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And after five days, Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, "Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by your providence, 3 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 4 But so that I may not be further tedious to you, I pray you, that you, of your clemency, would hear us briefly, 5 For we have found this a pestilent man, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarenes, 6 Who also has gone about to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law. 7 But the chief captain Lysias came and with great violence took him out of our hands, 8 Commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him, you yourself may take knowledge of all these things of which we accuse him." 9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>

  <p>10 Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, "Because I know that you have been for many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, 11 So that you may understand that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man; neither exciting the people to sedition, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city; 13 Neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. 14 But this I confess to you: that after the way which they call heresy, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets, 15 And having hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 16 And in this I exercise myself, to always have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men. 17 Now after many years, I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation, 18 Upon which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult, 19 Who ought to have been here before you and object if they had anything against me. 20 Or else, let these same here say if they have found any evil-doing in me while I stood before the council, 21 Unless it is for this one voice that I cried standing among them: 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.'"</p>

  <p>22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, "When Lysias the chief captain comes down, I will know the uttermost of your matter." 23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintances to minister or come to him.</p>

  <p>24 And after some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, "Depart for this time. When I have a convenient season, I will call for you." 26 He hoped also that money would have been given to him by Paul so that he might loose him. Therefore, he sent for him more often and communed with him. 27 But after two years, Porcius Festus came as successor to Felix. And Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
