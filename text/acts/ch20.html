  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to him, embraced them, and departed to go into Macedonia. 2 And when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, 3 And stayed there three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. 4 And these accompanied him into Asia: Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia. 5 These going before, tarried for us at Troas. 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came to them at Troas in five days, where we stayed seven days.</p>

  <p>7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them (ready to depart on the next day) and continued his speech until midnight. 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were assembled. 9 And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window, having fallen into a deep sleep. And as Paul was preaching yet longer, he sunk down with sleep, fell from the third loft, and was taken up dead. 10 And Paul went down and fell on him, and embracing him, said, "Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him." 11 When he had come up again, had broken bread, and eaten, he discoursed a long while, even until break of day, and then departed. 12 And they brought the young man alive and were greatly comforted.</p>

  <p>13 And we went before to a ship and sailed to Assos, intending to take in Paul there. For thus he had appointed, intending himself to go on foot. 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene. 15 And we sailed from there and came the next day over against Chios. And the next day we arrived at Samos and tarried at Trogyllium. And the next day we came to Miletus. 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus because he would not spend the time in Asia, for he hastened, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>

  <p>17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church. 18 And when they had come to him, he said to them, "You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews, 20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have shown you and have taught you publicly and from house to house, 21 Testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22 And now behold, I go bound in the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there, 23 Except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me. 24 But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p>

  <p>25 "And now behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. 26 Therefore, I call you to witness this day that I am pure from the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God. 28 Take heed therefore to yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to feed the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also from your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them. 31 Therefore, watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears. 32 And now, brothers, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 33 I have coveted no man's silver, gold, or apparel. 34 And you yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. 35 In all things I have shown you that in laboring this way you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</p>

  <p>36 And when he had said this, he kneeled down and prayed with them all. 37 And they all wept bitterly, fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.28] - Reference, 1st Corinthians 6:20, 7:23; Titus 2:14; 1st Peter 1:18-19, 3:18; Revelation 5:9.</p>
  <p>[v.35] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "We read this sentence in no place word for word; but the Evangelists have other not much unlike this, out of which Paul might gather this. Again, we know that all the sayings of Christ were not written; and he repeats that general doctrine of the contempt of money; whereof this is a true token, when a man is more bent to give than to take. Neither did Christ speak only politically, as if those who are liberal are therefore blessed, because they bind other men to them with their benefits, and it is a kind of bondage to owe anything; but he had respect to a higher thing, because, he which gives to the poor lends to the Lord, (Proverbs 19:17) that those be faithful and good stewards of God, who impart to their brothers some of that plenty which they have lent them; that men draw nearer to God in nothing than in liberality."</p>
