    <p class="ch-outline">The apostles, filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking various languages, are admired by some and derided by others, 1-13; whom Peter disproves, 14-36; he baptizes a great number who were converted, 37-40; who afterward devoutly and charitably converse together; the apostles working many miracles, and God daily increasing his church, 41-47.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And when the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 3 And there appeared to them cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>

  <p>5 And there were Jews dwelling at Jerusalem, devout men, from every nation under heaven. 6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together and were confounded because every man heard them speak in his own language. 7 And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, "Behold, are all these who speak not Galileans? 8 And how do we hear every man in our own language to which we were born? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, Cappadocia, in Pontus, Asia, 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, in Egypt, in the parts of Libya around Cyrene, strangers of Rome, both Jews and Proselytes, 11 Cretes and Arabians—we hear them speak in our languages the wonderful works of God." 12 And they were all amazed and in doubt, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" 13 Others mocking, said, "These men are full of new wine."</p>

  <p>14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said to them, "Men of Judea and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my words. 15 For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day. 16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:</p>

  <p>17 '<cite>And it shall come to pass in the last days,</cite>' says God, '<cite>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</cite></p>

  <p>18 <cite>And on my men-servants and on my women-servants I will, in those days, pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</cite></p>

  <p>19 <cite>And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth beneath: blood, fire, and vapor of smoke.</cite></p>

  <p>20 <cite>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord comes.</cite></p>

  <p>21 <cite>And it shall come to pass, that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</cite>'</p>

  <p>22 "Men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God among you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know, 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain, 24 Whom God has raised up, having released him from the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be held by it.</p>

  <p>25 "For David speaks concerning him, '<cite>I saw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand so that I should not be moved.</cite></p>

  <p>26 <cite>Therefore, my heart rejoiced and my tongue was glad. Moreover also, my flesh shall rest in hope.</cite></p>

  <p>27 <cite>For you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption.</cite></p>

  <p>28 <cite>You have made known to me the ways of life. You will make me full of joy with your countenance.</cite>'</p>

  <p>29 "Men, brothers, let me freely speak to you concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried and his sepulcher is with us to this day. 30 Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath that from the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, 31 He, seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption. 32 God has raised up this Jesus, of which we all are witnesses. 33 Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you now see and hear.</p>

  <p>34 "For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself, '<cite>The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit on my right hand,</cite></p>

  <p>35 <cite>Until I make your foes your footstool for your feet."</cite>'</p>

  <p>36 "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ."</p>

  <p>37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men, brothers, what shall we do?" 38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is to you, to your children, and to all who are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." 40 And with many other words he testified and exhorted, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation." 41 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls. 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>

  <p>43 And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things common, 45 And sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, ate their food with gladness and singleness of heart, 47 Praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added daily to the church those who were being saved.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.17-21] - Quoting Joel 2:28-32.</p>
  <p>[v.25-28] - Quoting Psalm 16:8-11 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.30] - Reference, Psalm 132:11-12.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - Reference, Psalm 16:10.</p>
  <p>[v.34-35] - Quoting Psalm 110:1 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.42] - Reference, Hebrews 10:25.</p>
  <p>[v.46-47] - Reference, Hebrews 10:25.</p>
  <p>[v.47] - "those who were being saved" - This was originally written as, "those who should be saved." The Greek does not support that rendering because the verb in this phrase is a present participle and not in the future tense.</p>
