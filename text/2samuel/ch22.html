  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.</p>

  <p>2 And he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,</p>

    <p>3&emsp;My God, my rock in whom I will trust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my high tower and my refuge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my preserver. You save me from violence.</p>

    <p>4&emsp;I will call on the LORD who is worthy to be praised.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So I shall be saved from my enemies.</p>

    <p>5&emsp;"When the waves of death compassed me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>

    <p>6&emsp;The sorrows of hell encompassed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The snares of death seized me.</p>

    <p>7&emsp;"In my distress I called upon the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cried to my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he heard my voice out of his temple,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my cry entered into his ears.</p>

    <p>8&emsp;"Then the earth shook and trembled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The foundations of heaven moved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shook because he was angry.</p>

    <p>9&emsp;There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fire out of his mouth devoured.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Coals were kindled by it.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;He bowed the heavens also, and came down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and darkness was under his feet.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;And he rode upon a cherub and flew,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And he made darkness a pavilion around him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a gathering of dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Through the brightness before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />coals of fire were kindled.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;The LORD thundered from heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the most High uttered his voice.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;And he sent out arrows and scattered them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lightning, and completely defeated them.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;And the channels of the sea appeared,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the foundations of the world were laid open,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the rebuking of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;"He sent from above and he took me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He drew me out of many waters.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;He delivered me from my strong enemy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;They fell upon me in the day of my calamity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD was my support.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;He brought me forth also into a large place.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He delivered me because he delighted in me.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;"The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;For I have kept the ways of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;For all his judgments were before me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;I was also upright before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have kept myself from my iniquity.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Therefore, the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to my cleanness in his eye-sight.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;"With the merciful you will show yourself merciful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the upright man you will show yourself upright.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;With the pure you will show yourself pure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the perverse you will contend.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;And the afflicted people you will save,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but your eyes are upon the haughty so that you may bring them down.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;For you are my lamp, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;For by you I have run through a troop.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />By my God I have leaped over a wall.</p>

    <p>31&emsp;As for God, his way is perfect.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The word of the LORD is tried.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is a buckler to all those who trust in him.</p>

    <p>32&emsp;"For who is God, except the LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who is a rock, except our God?</p>

    <p>33&emsp;God is my strength and power,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he makes my way perfect.</p>

    <p>34&emsp;He makes my feet like does' feet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sets me upon my high places.</p>

    <p>35&emsp;He teaches my hands to war<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.</p>

    <p>36&emsp;You have also given me the shield of your salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your gentleness has made me great.</p>

    <p>37&emsp;You have enlarged my steps under me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that my feet have not slipped.</p>

    <p>38&emsp;I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not turn back until I had consumed them.</p>

    <p>39&emsp;And I have consumed them and wounded them so that they could not arise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, they have fallen under my feet.</p>

    <p>40&emsp;For you have girded me with strength to battle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who rose up against me you have subdued under me.</p>

    <p>41&emsp;You have also given me the necks of my enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I might destroy those who hate me.</p>

    <p>42&emsp;They looked, but there was none to save,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</p>

    <p>43&emsp;Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I stamped them as the mire of the street and spread them abroad.</p>

    <p>44&emsp;"You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have kept me to be head of the heathen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A people which I did not know shall serve me.</p>

    <p>45&emsp;Strangers shall submit themselves to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.</p>

    <p>46&emsp;Strangers shall fade away<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall tremble from their close places.</p>

    <p>47&emsp;"The LORD lives.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed be my rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The God of the rock of my salvation is exalted.</p>

    <p>48&emsp;It is God who avenges me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who brings down the people under me,</p>

    <p>49&emsp;And who brings me forth from my enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You also have lifted me up on high above those who rose up against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have delivered me from the violent man.</p>

    <p>50&emsp;"Therefore, I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will sing praises to your name.</p>

    <p>51&emsp;He is the tower of salvation for his king<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shows mercy to his anointed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to David, and to his offspring forevermore."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/2-samuel/MHC%20-%202nd%20Samuel%2C%20Chapter%2022.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Samuel, Chapter 22</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1-51] - This song can be found in the Psalms as Psalm 18.</p>
  <p>[v.29] - This verse can easily be linked with the ministry of Christ. Psalm 119:105 states that, "Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path." That is of course referring to God's word, or rather, His Word. The opening of John's Gospel reveals a wondrous fact about the Word of God: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1), and then, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). Christ is not only God's Word, He is also, "the light of the world," and concerning this Light He said, "He who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (John 8:12). It is this Light that, "shines in darkness" (John 1:5), and is, "the true Light" (John 1:9).</p>
  <p>[v.44] - "A people which I did not know shall serve me" - Reference, Isaiah 55:5.</p>
  <p>[v.50] - Quoted in Romans 15:9.</p>
  <p>[v.51] - "to his seed forevermore" - This is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, the eternal King. See the comment for 1st Samuel 16:1.</p>
