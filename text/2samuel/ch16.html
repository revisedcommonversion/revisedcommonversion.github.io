  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of donkeys saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred bunches of raisins, one hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 2 And the king said to Ziba, "What do you mean by these?" And Ziba said, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine so that those who are faint in the wilderness may drink." 3 And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" And Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today the house of Israel shall restore to me the kingdom of my father.'" 4 Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that pertained to Mephibosheth is yours." And Ziba said, "I humbly implore you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king."</p>

  <p>5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man came out from there of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came forth and cursing as he came. 6 And he cast stones at David and at all the servants of king David. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 7 And thus Shimei said when he cursed: "Come out, come out, you bloody man, and you man of Belial. 8 The LORD has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned. And the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. And behold, you are taken in your mischief because you are a bloody man."</p>

  <p>9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head." 10 And the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, 'Curse David.' Who shall then say, 'Why have you done so?'" 11 And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "Behold, my son who came forth from my body seeks my life. How much more now may this Benjaminite do it? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has bidden him. 12 It may be that the LORD will look upon my affliction and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day." 13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him, and cast dust. 14 And the king and all the people who were with him arrived weary and refreshed themselves there.</p>

  <p>15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, "God save the king. God save the king." 17 And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this your kindness to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?" 18 And Hushai said to Absalom, "No, but whom the LORD, this people, and all the men of Israel choose, I will be his, and with him I will abide. 19 And again, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in your presence."</p>

  <p>20 Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give your counsel on what we shall do." 21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Go in to your father's concubines, which he has left to keep the house, and all Israel shall hear that you are abhorred by your father. Then the hands of all who are with you shall be strong." 22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house. And Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God. All the counsel of Ahithophel was so, both with David and with Absalom.</p>
