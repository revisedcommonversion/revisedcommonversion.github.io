  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>

  <p>2 And he smote Moab and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground. Even with two lines he measured to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants and brought gifts.</p>

  <p>3 David also smote Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the Euphrates River. 4 And David took from him one thousand chariots, seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. And David hamstrung all the chariot-horses, but reserved some of them for one hundred chariots. 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went. 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 And from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took an exceeding amount of brass.</p>

  <p>9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 10 Toi sent Joram his son to king David to salute him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him (for Hadadezer had wars with Toi). And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of brass, 11 Which also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all nations which he subdued: 12 From Syria, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, from Amalek, and from the plunder of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p>

  <p>13 And David made himself a name when he returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand men. 14 And he put garrisons in Edom. Throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the people of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.</p>

  <p>15 And David reigned over all Israel, and David executed judgment and justice to all his people. 16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder, 17 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests, Seraiah was the scribe, 18 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David's sons were chief ministers.</p>
