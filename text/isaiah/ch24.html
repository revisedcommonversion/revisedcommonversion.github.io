  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Behold, the LORD makes the earth empty, makes it waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />turns it upside down, and scatters abroad its inhabitants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with the servant, so with his master;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with the woman-servant, so with her mistress;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with the buyer, so with the seller;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with the lender, so with the borrower;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest to him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The land shall be utterly emptied and utterly plundered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has spoken this word.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The earth mourns and fades away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the world languishes and fades away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the haughty people of the earth languish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have transgressed the laws,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />changed the ordinance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and broken the everlasting covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, the curse has devoured the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who dwell in it are desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are burned<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and few men are left.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The new wine mourns, the vine languishes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all the merry-hearted sigh.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The mirth of tambourines ceases.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The noise of those who rejoice ends.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The joy of the harp ceases.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They shall not drink wine with a song.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Strong drink shall be bitter to those who drink it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The city of confusion is broken down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every house is shut up so that no man may enter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> There is a crying for wine in the streets.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All joy is darkened,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the mirth of the land is gone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Desolation is left in the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the gate is smitten with destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> So shall it be in the midst of the land among the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the shaking of an olive-tree,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> They shall lift up their voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall sing for the majesty of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall cry aloud from the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Therefore, glorify the LORD in the fires,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the name of the LORD God of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the coastlands of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> From the uttermost part of the earth we have heard songs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even glory to the righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But I said, "My leanness, my leanness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />woe to me!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Fear, the pit, and the snare are upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O inhabitant of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And it shall come to pass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that he who flees from the noise of the fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall fall into the pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who comes up out of the midst of the pit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be taken in the snare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the windows from on high are open<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the foundations of the earth shake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The earth is utterly broken down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth is entirely dissolved,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth is exceedingly moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall sway to and fro like a hammock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Its transgression shall be heavy upon it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall fall and not rise again.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the LORD shall punish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the host of the high ones who are on high<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> And they shall be gathered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as prisoners are gathered in the pit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be shut up in the prison,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and after many days they shall be visited.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Then the moon shall be confounded<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the sun ashamed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the LORD of hosts reigns<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on mount Zion, in Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and before his ancients gloriously.</p>
