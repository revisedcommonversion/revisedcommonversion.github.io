  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me because the LORD has anointed me to publish good tidings to the meek. He has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound,</p>

  <p>2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,</p>

  <p>3 To appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. And they will be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, so that he may be glorified.</p>

  <p>4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</p>

  <p>5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the foreigner shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.</p>

  <p>6 But you shall be named Priests of the LORD. Men shall call you Ministers of Our God. You shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory you shall boast yourselves.</p>

  <p>7 Instead of your shame you shall have double. Instead of disgrace they shall rejoice in their portion. Therefore, in their land they shall possess the double. Everlasting joy shall be to them.</p>

  <p>8 "For I, the LORD, love judgment. I hate robbery for burnt-offering. I will direct their work in truth and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</p>

  <p>9 And their descendants shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the people. All who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are a people the LORD has blessed."</p>

  <p>10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD. My soul shall be joyful in my God. He has clothed me with the garments of salvation. He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</p>

  <p>11 For as the earth brings forth her bud and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</p>
