    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who seek the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Look to the rock from where you are hewn,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the hole of the pit from where you are dug.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Look to Abraham your father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to Sarah who bore you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I called him alone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blessed him, and increased him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For the LORD will comfort Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will comfort all her waste places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will make her wilderness like Eden<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her desert like the garden of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Joy and gladness shall be found therein,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />thanksgiving and the voice of melody.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Listen to me, my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give ear to me, O my nation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For a law shall proceed from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> My righteousness is near.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My salvation has gone forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my arms shall judge the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The coastlands shall wait upon me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in my arm they shall trust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Lift up your eyes to the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and look upon the earth beneath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth shall become old like a garment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its inhabitants shall die in a like manner.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But my salvation shall be forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Listen to me, you who know righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the people in whose heart my law is.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not fear the reproach of men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither be afraid of their revilings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For the moth shall eat them like a garment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the worm shall eat them like wool.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But my righteousness shall be forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my salvation from generation to generation."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Awake, awake, put on your strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O arm of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Awake, as in the ancient days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the generations of old.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is it not you who cut Rahab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wounded the dragon?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Is it not you who dried the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the waters of the great deep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has made the depths of the sea a way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the ransomed to pass over?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Therefore, the redeemed of the LORD shall return<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and come with singing to Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and everlasting joy shall be upon their head.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall obtain gladness and joy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> "I, even I, am he who comforts you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who are you, that you should be afraid of a man who shall die,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of the son of man who shall be made as grass,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And forget the LORD your maker,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has stretched forth the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and laid the foundations of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have feared continually every day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the fury of the oppressor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as if he were ready to destroy?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where is the fury of the oppressor?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The captive exile hastens so that he may be released<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that he should not die in the pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor that his bread should fail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> But I am the LORD your God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who divided the sea, whose waves roared.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And I have put my words in your mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have covered you in the shadow of my hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may plant the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay the foundations of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say to Zion, 'You are my people.'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Awake, awake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />stand up, O Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which have drank at the hand of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the cup of his fury.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have drank the dregs of the cup of trembling<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wrung them out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> There is no one to guide her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among all the sons whom she has brought forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is there any who takes her by the hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of all the sons whom she has brought up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> There are two things that have come to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(who shall be sorry for you?):<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are desolation and destruction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />famine and the sword.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />By whom shall I comfort you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a wild bull in a net.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are full of the fury of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the rebuke of your God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Now therefore, hear this, you afflicted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drunken, but not with wine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Thus says your Lord Yahweh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your God who pleads the cause of his people:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I have taken out of your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br /> the cup of trembling,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the dregs of the cup of my fury.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall no longer drink it again.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have said to your soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Prostrate yourself so that we may go over.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So you have laid your body as the ground<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as the street to those who went over."</p>
