    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Why do you spend money for that which is not bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your labor for that which does not satisfy?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Incline your ear and come to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Hear, and your soul shall live.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will make an everlasting covenant with you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the sure mercies of David.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a leader and commander to the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and nations that did not know you shall run to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the LORD your God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Seek the LORD while he may be found,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />call upon him while he is near.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Let the wicked forsake his way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the unrighteous man his thoughts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let him return to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will have mercy upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he will abundantly pardon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither are your ways my ways," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> "For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so are my ways higher than your ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For as the rain comes down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the snow from heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not return there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but waters the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and makes it bring forth and bud<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it may give seed to the sower<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bread to the eater,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> So shall my word be that proceeds from my mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall not return to me void,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but it shall accomplish that which I please<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For you shall go out with joy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be led forth with peace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The mountains and the hills<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall break forth before you into singing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the trees of the field<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall clap their hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Instead of the thorn,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the fir-tree shall come up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and instead of the brier,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the myrtle-tree shall come up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be to the LORD for a name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."</p>
