  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, come, buy, and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</p>

  <p>2 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</p>

  <p>3 Incline your ear and come to me. Hear, and your soul shall live. And I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</p>

  <p>4 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</p>

  <p>5 Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and nations that did not know you shall run to you because of the LORD your God and for the Holy One of Israel, for he has glorified you."</p>

  <p>6 Seek the LORD while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</p>

  <p>7 Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts. And let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</p>

  <p>8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," says the LORD.</p>

  <p>9 "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

  <p>10 For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, but waters the earth and makes it bring forth and bud so that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater,</p>

  <p>11 So my word shall be that proceeds from my mouth. It shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.</p>

  <p>12 For you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace. The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</p>

  <p>13 Instead of the thorn, the fir-tree shall come up, and instead of the brier, the myrtle-tree shall come up, and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."</p>
