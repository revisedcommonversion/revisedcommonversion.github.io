  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; "Come down, and sit in the dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O virgin daughter of Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sit on the ground without a throne,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O daughter of the Chaldeans.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For you shall no longer be called<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />tender and delicate.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Take the millstones and grind meal.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Remove your veil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make the leg bare. Uncover the thigh.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pass over the rivers.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Your nakedness shall be uncovered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even your shame shall be seen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will take vengeance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will not meet you as a man."</p>

    <p>4&emsp; As for our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; "Sit silent, and get into darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O daughter of the Chaldeans,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you shall no longer be called,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Mistress of Kingdoms.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I was angry with my people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have polluted my inheritance<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and given them into your hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You showed them no mercy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Upon the ancient you have very <span class="linebr">/</span> <br />laid your yoke.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; And you said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I shall be a mistress forever,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you did not lay these things to your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither remembered its latter end.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Now therefore, hear this, you who are given to pleasures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who dwell carelessly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who say in your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I am, and no one else besides me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall not sit as a widow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall I know the loss of children.'</p>

    <p>9&emsp; But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the loss of children and widowhood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall come upon you in their perfection,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the multitude of your sorceries<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the great abundance of your enchantments.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For you have trusted in your wickedness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have said, 'No one sees me.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your wisdom and your knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it has perverted you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you have said in your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I am, and no one else besides me.'</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Therefore, evil shall come upon you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall not know from where it rises.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And mischief shall fall upon you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall not be able to put it off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And desolation shall come upon you suddenly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you shall not know.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Stand now with your enchantments<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the multitude of your sorceries<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which you have labored from your youth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It may be you are able to profit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Perhaps you may prevail.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now let the astrologers, the star-gazers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the monthly prognosticators<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />stand up and save <span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from these things that shall come upon you.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Behold, they shall be as stubble<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The fire shall burn them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall not deliver themselves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the power of the flame.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There shall not be a coal to warm at,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor fire to sit before it.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Thus they shall be to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with whom you have labored,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even your merchants, from your youth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall each wander to his quarter.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No one shall save you."</p>
