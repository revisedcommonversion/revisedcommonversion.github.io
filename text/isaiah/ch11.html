  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.</p>

  <p>2 And the Spirit of the LORD will rest upon him—the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD,</p>

  <p>3 And will make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD. And he will not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.</p>

  <p>4 But with righteousness he will judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. He will smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.</p>

  <p>5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his loins.</p>

  <p>6 The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid. The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf shall be together, and a little child shall lead them.</p>

  <p>7 And the cow and the bear shall feed. Their young ones shall lie down together. And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</p>

  <p>8 And the nursing child shall play near the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the den of the adder.</p>

  <p>9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>

  <p>10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people. The Gentiles shall seek it. And his rest shall be glorious.</p>

  <p>11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p>

  <p>12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>

  <p>13 The envy of Ephraim shall also depart and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off. Ephraim shall not envy Judah and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.</p>

  <p>14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west. They shall spoil those of the east together. They shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab. And the children of Ammon shall obey them.</p>

  <p>15 And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea. And with his mighty wind he will shake his hand over the river and will smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over in sandals.</p>

  <p>16 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria, as it was to Israel in the day that he came up from the land of Egypt.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/isaiah/MHC%20-%20Isaiah%2C%20Chapter%2011.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Isaiah, Chapter 11</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1] - Reference, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15; Zechariah 3:8, 6:12.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Paraphrased in Ephesians 6:14.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in Romans 15:12. The word, root, in this verse is a reference to Christ. Notice that Revelation 5:5 names the Root of David (David is the son of Jesse, Ruth 4:22). It is more plainly stated that Christ is the Root of David in Revelation 22:16, which says, "I, Jesus... am the root and the offspring of David..."</p>
