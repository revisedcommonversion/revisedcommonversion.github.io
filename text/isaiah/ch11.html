  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a Branch shall grow out of his roots.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And the Spirit of the LORD will rest upon him—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Spirit of counsel and might,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And will make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he will not judge after the sight of his eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> But with righteousness he will judge the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will smite the earth with the rod of his mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and faithfulness the girdle of his loins.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf shall be together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a little child shall lead them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And the cow and the bear shall feed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their young ones shall lie down together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And the nursing child shall play near the hole of the asp,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the weaned child shall put his hand on the den of the adder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They shall not hurt nor destroy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in all my holy mountain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the waters cover the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And in that day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Gentiles shall seek it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And his rest shall be glorious.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the Lord will set his hand again the second time<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to recover the remnant of his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which shall be left from Assyria, from Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from Pathros, from Cush, from Elam,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gather the dispersed of Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the four corners of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The envy of Ephraim shall also depart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ephraim shall not envy Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall plunder those of the east together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the children of Ammon shall obey them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And the LORD will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And with his mighty wind he will shake his hand over the river<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will smite it in the seven streams,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make men go over in sandals.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which shall be left from Assyria,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as it was to Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the day that he came up from the land of Egypt.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/isaiah/MHC%20-%20Isaiah%2C%20Chapter%2011.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Isaiah, Chapter 11</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1] - Reference, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15; Zechariah 3:8, 6:12.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Paraphrased in Ephesians 6:14.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in Romans 15:12. The word, root, in this verse is a reference to Christ. Notice that Revelation 5:5 names the Root of David (David is the son of Jesse, Ruth 4:22). It is more plainly stated that Christ is the Root of David in Revelation 22:16, which says, "I, Jesus... am the root and the offspring of David..."</p>
