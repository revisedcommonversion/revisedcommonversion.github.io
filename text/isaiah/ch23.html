  <p>1 [<span class="it">The burden of Tyre.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Howl, you ships of Tarshish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Be still, you inhabitants of the coastland,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you whom the merchants of Zidon, who pass over the sea, have replenished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And by great waters the seed of Sihor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the harvest of the river, is her revenue,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she is a market of nations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Be ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea has spoken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the strength of the sea, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I do not travail nor bring forth children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither do I nourish young men nor bring up virgins."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> As at the report concerning Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Pass over to Tarshish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Howl, you inhabitants of the coast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Is this your joyous city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose antiquity is of ancient days?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her own feet shall carry her far off to sojourn.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose merchants are princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose traders are the honorable of the earth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The LORD of hosts has purposed it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to stain the pride of all glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Pass through your land like a river,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O daughter of Tarshish. There is no more strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> He stretched his hand over the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shook the kingdoms.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD has given a commandment against the merchant city<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to destroy its strongholds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And he said, "You shall no longer rejoice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, pass over to Chittim.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall have no rest there also."</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not, until the Assyrian founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up its towers, they raised up its palaces, and they brought it to ruin.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Howl, you ships of Tarshish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your strength is laid waste.</p>
  </div>

  <p>15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten for seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years, it shall happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Take a harp,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />go throughout the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you harlot who has been forgotten.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make sweet melody<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sing many songs<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may be remembered.</p>
  </div>

  <p>17 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her wages and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. 18 And her merchandise and her wages shall be holiness to the LORD. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her merchandise shall be for those who dwell before the LORD, for sufficient food and for durable clothing.</p>
