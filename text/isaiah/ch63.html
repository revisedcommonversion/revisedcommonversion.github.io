  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Who is this who comes from Edom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with dyed garments from Bozrah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />this who is glorious in his apparel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />traveling in the greatness of his strength?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Why are you red in your apparel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your garments like him who treads in the wine-vat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "I have trodden the wine-press alone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of the people there was no one with me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I will tread them in my anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trample them in my fury,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will stain all my clothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For the day of vengeance is in my heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the year of my redeemed has come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And I looked, and there was no one to help.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I wondered that there was no one to uphold.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, my own arm brought salvation to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And my fury, it upheld me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And I will tread down the people in my anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make them drunk in my fury,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bring their strength down to the earth."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the praises of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to all that the LORD has bestowed on us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For he said, "Surely they are my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />children who will not lie."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So he was their Savior.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> In all their affliction he was afflicted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the angel of his presence saved them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he bore them and carried them all the days of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, he was turned to be their enemy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he fought against them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where is he who brought them out of the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the shepherd of his flock?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where is he who put his Holy Spirit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />within him,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Who led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />dividing the water before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make himself an everlasting name,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Who led them through the deep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a horse in the wilderness, so that they should not stumble?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> As a beast goes down in the valley,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus you led your people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make yourself a glorious name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Look down from heaven and behold<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where is your zeal and your strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sounding of your heart and of your mercy toward me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Are they restrained?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Doubtless you are our Father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though Abraham is ignorant of us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel does not acknowledge us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You, O LORD, are our Father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />our Redeemer. Your name is from everlasting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> O LORD, why have you made us to err from your ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hardened our heart from your fear?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Return for your servants' sake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the tribes of your inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> We are yours. You never bore rule over them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They were not called by your name.</p>
