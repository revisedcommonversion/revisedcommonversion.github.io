  <p>1 [<span class="it">The burden of the valley of vision.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">What ails you now, that you have wholly gone up to the house-tops?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The tumultuous city, the joyous city, is full of noise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> All your rulers have fled together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are bound by the archers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All who are found in you are bound together, who have fled from far.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I said, "Look away from me. I will weep bitterly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not labor to comfort me because of the devastation of the daughter of my people."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For it is a day of trouble, of treading down, and of perplexity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Kir uncovered the shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass, that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And he uncovered the coverings of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you looked in that day to the armor of the house of the forest.</p>
  </div>

  <p>9 You have also seen the breaches of the city of David, that they are many. And you collected the waters of the lower pool.</p>

  <p>10 And you have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses you have broken down to fortify the wall.</p>

  <p>11 You also made a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">But you have not looked to its maker,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither had respect to him who fashioned it long ago.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And in that day the Lord GOD of hosts called<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And behold, there is joy and gladness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />slaying oxen, killing sheep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />eating flesh, and drinking wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And it was revealed in my ears by the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you until you die,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Thus says the Lord GOD of hosts:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Go, get yourself to this treasurer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> 'What are you doing here? And who do you have here<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have hewed yourself out a sepulcher here,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as he who hews himself out a sepulcher on high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and who engraves a habitation for himself in a rock?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Behold, the LORD will carry you away with a mighty captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will surely cover you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> With violence he will surely turn and toss you like a ball into a wide country.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There you shall die, and there the chariots of your glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be the shame of your lord's house.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And I will drive you from your station,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from your state he shall pull you down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And I will clothe him with your robe<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strengthen him with your girdle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will commit your government into his hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> And the key of the house of David I will lay upon his shoulder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So he shall open, and no one shall shut.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall shut, and no one shall open.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the descendants, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. 25 In that day," says the LORD of hosts, "the nail that is fastened in the sure place shall give way, be cut down, and fall. And the burden that was upon it shall be cut off. For the LORD has spoken it."</p>
