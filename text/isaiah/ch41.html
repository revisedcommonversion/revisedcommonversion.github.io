    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Keep silence before me, O coastlands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the people renew their strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them come near, then let them speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let us come near together for judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Who raised up the righteous man from the east,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />called him to his foot,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />gave the nations before him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made him rule over kings?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He gave them as the dust to his sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as driven stubble to his bow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He pursued them and passed safely,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Who has wrought and done it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />calling the generations from the beginning?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, the LORD, the first<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the last, I am he."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The coastlands saw it and feared.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The ends of the earth were afraid,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />drew near, and came.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> They each helped his neighbor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and each said to his brother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Be of good courage."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who smooths with the hammer<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />encouraged him who smote the anvil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, "It is ready for the soldering."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he fastened it with nails<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it should not be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "But you, Israel, are my servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Jacob whom I have chosen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the offspring of Abraham my friend,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and called you from the chief men thereof,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and said to you, 'You are my servant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have chosen you and not cast you away.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Do not fear, for I am with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will strengthen you and I will even help you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Behold, all those who were incensed against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be ashamed and confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be as nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who contend with you shall perish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> You shall seek them, and shall not find them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even those who contended with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who war against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be as nothing, as a thing that does not exist.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For I, the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will hold your right hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying to you, 'Do not fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will help you.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Do not fear, you worm Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you men of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will help you," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />having teeth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall thresh the mountains and beat them small,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall make the hills as chaff.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry them away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the whirlwind shall scatter them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall rejoice in the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and glory in the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> When the poor and needy seek water and there is none,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their tongue fails for thirst,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, the LORD, will hear them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> I will open rivers in high places<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fountains in the midst of the valleys.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make the wilderness a pool of water<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the dry land springs of water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> I will plant in the wilderness the cedar,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the shittah-tree, the myrtle, and the oil-tree.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the box-tree together,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> So that they may see, know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />consider, and understand together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the hand of the LORD has done this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Produce your cause," says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Bring forth your strong reasons," says the King of Jacob.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "Let them bring them forth and show us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />what shall happen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them show the former things, what they are,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may consider them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and know the latter end of them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or declare to us things to come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Show the things that are to come hereafter<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may know that you are gods.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, do good or do evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may be dismayed and behold it together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Behold, you are of nothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your work is of nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who chooses you is an abomination.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall come upon princes as upon mortar,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as the potter treads clay.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Who has declared from the beginning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and beforehand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may say, 'He is righteous'?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely, there is no one who shows.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely, there is no one who declares.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely, there is no one who hears your words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> The first shall say to Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Behold, behold them.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will give to Jerusalem<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />one who brings good tidings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> For I beheld, and there was no man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even among them, and there was no counselor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Behold, they are all vanity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their works are nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their molten images are wind and confusion."</p>
