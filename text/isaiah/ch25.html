  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O LORD, you are my God. I will exalt you. I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things. Your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.</p>

  <p>2 For you have made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city, it shall never be built.</p>

  <p>3 Therefore, the strong people shall glorify you, the city of the terrible nations shall fear you.</p>

  <p>4 For you have been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</p>

  <p>5 You will bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place, even the heat with the shade of a cloud. The branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>

  <p>6 And on this mountain the LORD of hosts will make for all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the dregs, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the dregs well refined.</p>

  <p>7 And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations.</p>

  <p>8 He will swallow up death in victory. And the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the rebuke of his people he will remove from all the earth. For the LORD has spoken it.</p>

  <p>9 And it shall be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God. We have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the LORD. We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation."</p>

  <p>10 For on this mountain the hand of the LORD shall rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>

  <p>11 And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim. And he will bring down their pride together with the tricks of their hands.</p>

  <p>12 And the fortress of the high fort of your walls he will bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.</p>
