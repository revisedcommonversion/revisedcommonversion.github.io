  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> O LORD, you are my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will exalt you. I will praise your name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have done wonderful things.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For you have made of a city a heap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of a fortified city a ruin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a palace of strangers to be no city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it shall never be built.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Therefore, the strong people shall glorify you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the city of the terrible nations shall fear you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For you have been a defense to the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a defense to the needy in his distress,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the blast of the terrible ones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is as a storm against the wall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You will bring down the noise of strangers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the heat in a dry place,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the heat with the shade of a cloud.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And on this mountain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD of hosts will make for all people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a feast of fat things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a feast of wines on the dregs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of fat things full of marrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of wines on the dregs well refined.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And he will destroy on this mountain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the face of the covering cast over all people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the veil that is spread over all nations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He will swallow up death in victory.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the Lord GOD will wipe away tears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from off all faces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rebuke of his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will remove from all the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the LORD has spoken it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And it shall be said in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, this is our God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have waited for him, and he will save us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This is the LORD. We have waited for him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For on this mountain the hand of the LORD shall rest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Moab shall be trodden down under him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as he who swims spreads forth his hands to swim.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he will bring down their pride together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the tricks of their hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And the fortress of the high fort of your walls<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will bring down, lay low,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bring to the ground, even to the dust.</p>
