  <p>1 In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"We have a strong city.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />God will appoint salvation for walls and bulwarks.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Open the gates<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he trusts in you.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Trust in the LORD forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in the LORD YAHWEH is everlasting strength.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; For he brings down those who dwell on high.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lofty city, he lays it low.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He lays it low, even to the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He brings it even to the dust.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The foot shall tread it down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy."</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The way of the just is uprightness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You, most upright, weigh the path of the just.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Even in the way of your judgments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD, we have waited for you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The desire of our soul is to your name and to the remembrance of you.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; With my soul I have desired you in the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, with my spirit within me I will seek you early.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For when your judgments are in the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;LORD, when your hand is lifted up, they will not see.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even the fire of your enemies shall devour them.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;LORD, you will ordain peace for us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you also have wrought all our works in us.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;O LORD our God, other lords beside you have had dominion over us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but by you only we will make mention of your name.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;They are dead, they shall not live.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are deceased, they shall not rise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, you have visited and destroyed them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made all their memory to perish.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;You have increased the nation, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have increased the nation. You are glorified<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have enlarged all the borders of the land.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;LORD, in trouble they have visited you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They poured out a prayer when your chastening was upon them.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;As a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is in pain and cries out in her pangs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so we have been in your sight, O LORD.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;We have been with child. We have been in pain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have, it seems, brought forth wind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have not wrought any deliverance on the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Your dead men shall live. Together with my dead body they shall arise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your dew is as the dew of herbs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the earth shall cast out the dead.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Come, my people, enter into your chambers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shut your doors around you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Hide yourself for a little while<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until the indignation has passed.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;For behold, the LORD comes out of his place<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The earth shall also disclose her blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall no longer cover her slain.</p>
