  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Thus says the LORD: "Keep judgment and do justice, for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed.</p>

  <p>2 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold upon it, who keeps the sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil."</p>

  <p>3 Do not let the son of the stranger, who has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, "The LORD has utterly separated me from his people," neither let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."</p>

  <p>4 For thus says the LORD: "To the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant,</p>

  <p>5 Even to them I will give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.</p>

  <p>6 Also the sons of the stranger, who join themselves to the LORD to serve him, to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the sabbath from profaning it, and takes hold of my covenant,</p>

  <p>7 Even them I will bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people."</p>

  <p>8 The Lord GOD who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, "Yet I will gather others to him, besides those who are gathered to him."</p>

  <p>9 All you beasts of the field, come to devour, even all you beasts in the forest.</p>

  <p>10 His watchmen are blind. They are all ignorant. They are all mute dogs that cannot bark. They are sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</p>

  <p>11 Indeed, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds who cannot understand. They all look to their own way, each for his gain, from his quarter.</p>

  <p>12 "Come," they say, "I will bring wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink, and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant."</p>
