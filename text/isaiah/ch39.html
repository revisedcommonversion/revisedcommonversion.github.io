  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 2 And Hezekiah rejoiced over them and showed them the house of his precious things: the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment, all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah did not show them. 3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah and said to him, "What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?" And Hezekiah said, "They have come to me from a far country, even from Babylon." 4 Then he said, "What have they seen in your house?" And Hezekiah answered, "All that is in my house they have seen. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them."</p>

  <p>5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 6 'Behold, the days come, that all that is in your house and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,' says the LORD. 7 'And of your sons who shall issue from you, which you shall beget, they shall take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.'" 8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Good is the word of the LORD which you have spoken." He said moreover, "For there shall be peace and truth in my days."</p>
