  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Nevertheless, there shall be no more gloom to her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time, he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon them the light has shined.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You have multiplied the nation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have increased its joy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They joy before you according to the joy in harvest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as men rejoice when they divide the plunder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For you have broken the yoke of his burden<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the staff of his shoulder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the rod of his oppressor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as in the day of Midian.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the garments rolled in blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be for burning and fuel for the fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For to us a child is born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to us a son is given.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the government shall be upon his shoulder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And his name shall be called<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Of the increase of his government<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and peace there shall be no end,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to order it and to establish it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with judgment and with justice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from now on even forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The Lord sent a word into Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it has fallen upon Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And all the people shall know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who say in the pride and stoutness of heart,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Therefore, the LORD will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and join his enemies together,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The Syrians before and the Philistines behind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall devour Israel with open mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For all this his anger is not turned away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his hand is stretched out still.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For the people do not turn to him who smites them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore, the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />branch and rush, in one day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The ancient and honorable, he is the head,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For the leaders of this people cause them to err,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are led by them are destroyed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Therefore, the Lord will have no joy in their young men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will he have mercy on their fatherless and widows,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for everyone is a hypocrite and an evil-doer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and every mouth speaks folly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For all this his anger is not turned away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his hand is stretched out still.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> For wickedness burns as the fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall devour the briers and thorns<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall mount up like the rising of smoke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is darkened,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No man shall spare his brother.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every man shall eat the flesh of his own arm.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Manasseh is against Ephraim, Ephraim is against Manasseh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and together they are against Judah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For all this his anger is not turned away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
