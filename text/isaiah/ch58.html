  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; "Cry aloud, do not spare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lift up your voice like a trumpet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and show my people their transgression<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the house of Jacob their sins.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Yet they seek me daily<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delight to know my ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a nation that did righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not forsake the ordinance of their God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They ask of me the ordinances of justice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They take delight in approaching to God.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; 'Why have we fasted, they say, and you do not see?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and exact all your labors.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Behold, you fast for strife and debate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to smite with the fist of wickedness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall not fast as you do this day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Is this the fast that I have chosen:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a day for a man to afflict his soul?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you call this a fast<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and an acceptable day to the LORD?</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Is this not the fast that I have chosen:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to release the bonds of wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to undo the heavy burdens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to let the oppressed go free,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that you break every yoke?</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that you should bring the poor who are cast out to your house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you see the naked that you should cover him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that you should not hide yourself from your own flesh?</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Then your light shall break forth as the morning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your health shall spring forth speedily.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your righteousness shall go before you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The glory of the LORD shall be your rear-ward.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall cry, and he will say, 'Here I am.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If you take away from the midst of you the yoke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity,</p>

    <p>10&emsp;And if you draw out your soul to the hungry<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and satisfy the afflicted soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then your light shall rise in obscurity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your darkness shall be as the noon day.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;And the LORD will guide you continually,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and satisfy your soul in drought<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make your bones fat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall be like a watered garden<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And those amidst you shall build the old waste places.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall raise up the foundations of many generations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be called, The Repairer of the Breach,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Restorer of Paths to Dwell In.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;If you turn away your foot from the sabbath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from doing your pleasure on my holy day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and call the sabbath a delight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the holy [day] of the LORD honorable,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and honor him, not doing your own ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Then you shall delight yourself in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."</p>
