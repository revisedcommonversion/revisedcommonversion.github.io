  <p>1 [<span class="it">The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Lift up a banner upon the high mountain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />exalt the voice to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shake the hand so that they may go<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the gates of the nobles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I have commanded my sanctified ones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have also called my mighty ones for my anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even those who rejoice in my highness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The noise of a multitude is in the mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as of a great people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of nations assembled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts musters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the host of the battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They come from a far country,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the end of heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to destroy the whole land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Howl, for the day of the LORD is at hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Therefore, all hands shall be faint,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />every man's heart shall melt,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And they shall be afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be in pain as a woman who travails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be amazed at one another.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their faces shall be as flames.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Behold, the day of the LORD comes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to lay the land desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he will destroy its sinners out of it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For the stars of heaven and its constellations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall not give their light.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sun shall be darkened in his going forth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And I will punish the world for their evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wicked for their iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I will make a man more precious than fine gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Therefore, I will shake the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the earth shall be shaken out of her place<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the wrath of the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the day of his fierce anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And it shall be as the chased gazelle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a sheep that no man takes up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every man shall turn to his own people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and flee each to his own land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Everyone who is found shall be thrust through.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And everyone who is joined to them shall fall by the sword.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Their children shall also be dashed to pieces before their eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their houses shall be plundered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their wives ravished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who shall not regard silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their eye shall not spare children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the beauty of the Chaldeans' excellence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> It shall never be inhabited,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And owls shall dwell there<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wild goats shall dance there.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> And the wolves shall cry in their desolate houses<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and jackals in their pleasant palaces.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And her time is near to come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her days shall not be prolonged.</p>
