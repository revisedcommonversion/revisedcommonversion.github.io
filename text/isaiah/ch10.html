  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and who write grievousness which they have prescribed,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> To turn aside the needy from judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to take away the right from the poor of my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that widows may be their plunder<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that they may rob the fatherless!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And what will you do in the day of visitation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the desolation which shall come from far?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To whom will you flee for help?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where will you leave your glory?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall fall under the slain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For all this his anger is not turned away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his hand is stretched out still.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O Assyrian, the rod of my anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the staff in their hand is my indignation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I will send him against a hypocritical nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and against the people of my wrath I will give him a charge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to take the loot, to take the plunder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Although he does not mean so,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does his heart think so,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet it is in his heart to destroy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cut off many nations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For he says, "Are my princes not altogether kings?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Is Calno not as Carchemish?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is Hamath not as Arpad?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is Samaria not as Damascus?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose engraved images excelled those of Jerusalem and of Samaria,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do so to Jerusalem and her idols?"</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 Therefore, it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his high looks.</p>

  <p>13 For he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"By the strength of my hand I have done it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by my wisdom, for I am prudent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I have removed the bounds of the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have robbed their treasures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And as one gathers eggs that are left,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have gathered all the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there was no one who moved the wing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or opened the mouth, or peeped."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Shall the ax boast itself against him who hews with it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />That would be as if the rod should shake itself against those who lift it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or as if the staff should lift itself as if it were not wood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Therefore, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will send leanness among his fat ones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and under his glory he will kindle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a burning like the burning of a fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his Holy One for a flame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall burn and devour his thorns<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his briers in one day,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both soul and body,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that a child may write them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the remnant of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who have escaped of the house of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall no longer again lean upon him who smote them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but shall lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the mighty God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For though your people Israel are as the sand of the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet a remnant of them shall return.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a consumption, even determined,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of all the land.</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: "O my people who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian. He shall smite you with a rod and shall lift up his staff against you after the manner of Egypt. 25 For yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction. 26 And the LORD of hosts will raise up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. And as his rod was upon the sea, so he shall lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder and his yoke from off your neck. And the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> He has come to Aiath<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has passed to Migron.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At Michmash he has laid up his baggage.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> They have gone over the passage.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have taken up their lodging at Geba.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ramah is afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Gibeah of Saul has fled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Madmenah has fled away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> As yet he shall remain at Nob that day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall shake his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the hill of Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will lop the bough with terror,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the haughty shall be humbled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with iron,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</p>
