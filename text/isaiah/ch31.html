  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!</p>

  <p>2 Yet he is also wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers and against the help of those who work iniquity.</p>

  <p>3 Now the Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit. When the LORD stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall fall and he who is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.</p>

  <p>4 For thus the LORD has spoken to me: "As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, and he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for their noise, so the LORD of hosts will come down to fight for mount Zion and for the hill thereof.</p>

  <p>5 As birds flying, so the LORD of hosts will defend Jerusalem. Defending, he will also deliver it. And passing over, he will preserve it."</p>

  <p>6 Turn to him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. 7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made for you for a sin.</p>

  <p>8 "Then the Assyrian shall fall with the sword, not of a mighty man. And the sword, not of a common man, shall devour him. But he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be forced labor.</p>

  <p>9 And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign," says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>
