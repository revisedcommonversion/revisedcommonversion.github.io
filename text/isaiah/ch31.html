  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rely on horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trust in chariots because they are many,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in horsemen because they are very strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither seek the LORD!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Yet he is also wise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will bring evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not call back his words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but will arise against the house of the evil-doers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and against the help of those who work iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Now the Egyptians are men and not God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their horses flesh and not spirit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the LORD stretches out his hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both he who helps shall fall and he who is helped shall fall down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they all shall fail together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For thus the LORD has spoken to me:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will not be afraid of their voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor abase himself for their noise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so the LORD of hosts will come down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to fight for mount Zion and for the hill thereof.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> As birds flying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so the LORD of hosts will defend Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Defending, he will also deliver it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And passing over, he will preserve it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Turn to him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which your own hands have made for you for a sin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "Then the Assyrian shall fall with the sword, not of a mighty man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the sword, not of a common man, shall devour him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But he shall flee from the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his young men shall be forced labor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD, whose fire is in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>
