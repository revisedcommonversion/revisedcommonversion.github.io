  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Cush,</p>

    <p>2 That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, "Go, you swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people awesome from their beginning until now, a nation measured by line and trodden down, whose land the rivers have laid waste."</p>

    <p>3 All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth, see when he lifts up an ensign on the mountains. And when he blows a trumpet, hear.</p>

    <p>4 For thus the LORD said to me: "I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling-place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."</p>

    <p>5 For before the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks and take away and cut down the branches.</p>

    <p>6 They shall be left together to the birds of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth. And the birds shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 In that time the present shall be brought to the LORD of hosts from a people scattered and peeled, and from a people awesome from their beginning until now, a nation measured by line and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have divided, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, mount Zion.</p>
