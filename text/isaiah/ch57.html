  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The righteous perish, and no man lays it to heart. And merciful men are taken away, no one considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</p>

  <p>2 He shall enter into peace. They shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.</p>

  <p>3 "But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the lewd.</p>

  <p>4 Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth and thrust out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p>

  <p>5 Inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the cliffs of the rocks?</p>

  <p>6 Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion. They, they are your lot. Even to them you have poured a drink-offering. You have offered a food-offering. Should I receive comfort in these?</p>

  <p>7 Upon a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed. Even there you went up to offer sacrifice.</p>

  <p>8 Behind the doors and also the posts you have set up your remembrance, for you have uncovered yourself to someone other than me and have gone up. You have enlarged your bed and made yourself a covenant with them. You loved their bed where you saw it.</p>

  <p>9 And you went to the king with ointment and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far off, and debased yourself even to hell.</p>

  <p>10 You are wearied in the greatness of your way, yet you did not say, 'There is no hope.' You have found the life of your hand; therefore, you were not grieved.</p>

  <p>11 And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not held my peace even of old, and you do not fear me?</p>

  <p>12 I will declare your righteousness and your works, for they shall not profit you.</p>

  <p>13 When you cry, let your companies deliver you. But the wind shall carry them all away. Vanity shall take them. But he who puts his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain."</p>

  <p>14 He shall say, "Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people."</p>

  <p>15 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: "I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>

  <p>16 For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry, for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</p>

  <p>17 For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and smote him. I hid myself and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</p>

  <p>18 I have seen his ways and will heal him. I will lead him also and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</p>

  <p>19 I create the fruit of the lips. Peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near," says the LORD, "and I will heal him."</p>

  <p>20 But the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>

  <p>21 "There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."</p>
