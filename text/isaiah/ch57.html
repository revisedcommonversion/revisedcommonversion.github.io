  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> The righteous perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no man lays it to heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And merciful men are taken away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />no one considering<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> He shall enter into peace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall rest in their beds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each one walking in his uprightness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "But draw near here,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you sons of the sorceress,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the offspring of the adulterer and the lewd.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Who are you mocking?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Against whom do you make a wide mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and thrust out the tongue?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Are you not children of transgression,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />offspring of falsehood,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Inflaming yourselves with idols<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />under every green tree,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />slaying the children in the valleys<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />under the cliffs of the rocks?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They, they are your lot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even to them you have poured a drink-offering.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have offered a food-offering.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Should I receive comfort in these?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Upon a lofty and high mountain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have set your bed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even there you went up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to offer sacrifice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Behind the doors and also the posts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have set up your remembrance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have uncovered yourself to someone other than me and have gone up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have enlarged your bed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made yourself a covenant with them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You loved their bed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where you saw it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And you went to the king with ointment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and increased your perfumes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sent your messengers far off,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and debased yourself even to hell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You are wearied in the greatness of your way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet you did not say, 'There is no hope.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have found the life of your hand;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, you were not grieved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And of whom have you been afraid or feared,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have lied and have not remembered me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor laid it to your heart?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have I not held my peace even of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you do not fear me?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I will declare your righteousness and your works,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall not profit you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> When you cry, let your companies deliver you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the wind shall carry them all away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Vanity shall take them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But he who puts his trust in me shall possess the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall inherit my holy mountain."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He shall say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Cast up, cast up, prepare the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For thus says the high and lofty One<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I dwell in the high and holy place,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to revive the spirit of the humble<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For I will not contend forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will I always be angry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the spirit would fail before me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the souls which I have made.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and smote him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I hid myself and was angry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> I have seen his ways and will heal him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will lead him also and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> I create the fruit of the lips.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and I will heal him."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> But the wicked are like the troubled sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> "There is no peace,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says my God, "for the wicked."</p>
