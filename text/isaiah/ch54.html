    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Sing, O barren, you who did not bear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Break forth into singing and cry aloud,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who did not travail with child.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For more are the children of the desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than the children of the married wife,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Enlarge the place of your tent,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let them extend the curtains of your habitations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not spare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lengthen your cords,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strengthen your stakes,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For you shall break forth on the right hand and on the left,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your offspring shall inherit the Gentiles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Do not fear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you shall not be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not be confounded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you shall not be put to shame.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For you shall forget the shame of your youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall not remember the reproach<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of your widowhood anymore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For your maker is your husband.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall be called The God of the Whole Earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For the LORD has called you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even as a wife of youth when she is refused,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says your God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> "For a small moment I have forsaken you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but with great mercies I will gather you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> In a little wrath<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I hid my face from you for a moment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but with everlasting kindness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will have mercy on you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD your Redeemer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> "For this is as the waters of Noah to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall no longer overflow the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor rebuke you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For the mountains shall depart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the hills be removed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but my kindness shall not depart from you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD who has mercy on you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> "Oh you afflicted, tossed with tempest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not comforted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behold, I will lay your stones with fair colors<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay your foundations with sapphires.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And I will make your windows of agates,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your gates of carbuncles,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all your borders of pleasant stones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And all your children shall be taught from the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the peace of your children shall be great.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> In righteousness you shall be established.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall be far from oppression,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you shall not fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall be far from terror,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it shall not come near you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, they shall surely assemble but not by me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Behold, I have created the smith<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who blows the coals in the fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brings forth an instrument for his work.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I have created the waster to destroy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And every tongue that rises against you in judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall condemn.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their righteousness is from me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
