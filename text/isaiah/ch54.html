  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Sing, O barren, you who did not bear. Break forth into singing and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child. For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife," says the LORD.</p>

  <p>2 "Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them extend the curtains of your habitations. Do not spare, lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes,</p>

  <p>3 For you shall break forth on the right hand and on the left, and your seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>

  <p>4 Do not fear, for you shall not be ashamed. Do not be confounded, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.</p>

  <p>5 For your maker is your husband. The LORD of hosts is his name. And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. He shall be called The God of the Whole Earth.</p>

  <p>6 For the LORD has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, even as a wife of youth when she is refused," says your God.</p>

  <p>7 "For a small moment I have forsaken you, but with great mercies I will gather you.</p>

  <p>8 In a little wrath I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on you," says the LORD your Redeemer.</p>

  <p>9 "For this is as the waters of Noah to me. For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no longer overflow the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.</p>

  <p>10 For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed," says the LORD who has mercy on you.</p>

  <p>11 "Oh you afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with fair colors and lay your foundations with sapphires.</p>

  <p>12 And I will make your windows of agates, your gates of carbuncles, and all your borders of pleasant stones.</p>

  <p>13 And all your children shall be taught from the LORD, and the peace of your children shall be great.</p>

  <p>14 In righteousness you shall be established. You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear. You shall be far from terror, for it shall not come near you.</p>

  <p>15 Behold, they shall surely assemble but not by me. Whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake.</p>

  <p>16 Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coals in the fire and brings forth an instrument for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.</p>

  <p>17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper. And every tongue that rises against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is from me," says the LORD.</p>
