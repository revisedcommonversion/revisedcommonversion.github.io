    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the mountains might flow down at your presence—</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> As when the fire burns brushwood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fire causes the waters to boil—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make your name known to your adversaries<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the nations may tremble at your presence!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> When you did awesome things<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which we did not look for,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For since the beginning of the world men have not heard,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor perceived by the ear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither has the eye seen, O God, besides you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />what he has prepared for him who waits for him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />those who remember you in your ways.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, you are angry, for we have sinned.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We continued in them, and we shall be saved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> But we are all as an unclean thing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And we all fade as a leaf.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And there is no one who calls upon your name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who stirs up himself to take hold of you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have hid your face from us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have consumed us because of our iniquities.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But now, O LORD, you are our father.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We are the clay, and you our potter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we are all the work of your hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Do not be very angry, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither remember iniquity forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, see, we implore you, we are all your people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Your holy cities are a wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Zion is a wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Jerusalem a desolation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Our holy and our beautiful house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where our fathers praised you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is burned with fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you hold your peace and grievously afflict us?</p>
