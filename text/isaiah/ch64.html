  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, so that the mountains might flow down at your presence—</p>

  <p>2 As when the fire burns brushwood and the fire causes the waters to boil—to make your name known to your adversaries so that the nations may tremble at your presence!</p>

  <p>3 When you did awesome things which we did not look for, you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence.</p>

  <p>4 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, besides you, what he has prepared for him who waits for him.</p>

  <p>5 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you are angry, for we have sinned. We continued in them, and we shall be saved.</p>

  <p>6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. And we all fade as a leaf. And our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

  <p>7 And there is no one who calls upon your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you, for you have hid your face from us and have consumed us because of our iniquities.</p>

  <p>8 But now, O LORD, you are our father. We are the clay, and you our potter, and we are all the work of your hand.</p>

  <p>9 Do not be very angry, O LORD, neither remember iniquity forever. Behold, see, we implore you, we are all your people.</p>

  <p>10 Your holy cities are a wilderness. Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</p>

  <p>11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</p>

  <p>12 Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD? Will you hold your peace and grievously afflict us?</p>
