  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; But now thus says the LORD who created you, O Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who formed you, O Israel:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Do not fear, for I have redeemed you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have called you by your name. You are mine.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And [when you pass] through the rivers, they shall not overflow you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the flame kindle upon you.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For I am the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I gave Egypt for your ransom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cush and Seba for you.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Since you have been precious in my sight, you have been honorable,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have loved you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore I will give men in your stead<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and people for your life.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Do not fear, for I am with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will bring your offspring from the east<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gather you from the west.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I will say to the north, 'Give up,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the south, 'Do not keep back.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bring my sons from far<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my daughters from the ends of the earth,</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Even everyone who is called by my name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I have created him for my glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have formed him. Truly, I have made him."</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Bring forth the blind people who have eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the deaf who have ears.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Let all the nations be collected<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the people be assembled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who among them can declare this<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and show us former things?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them bring forth their witnesses so that they may be justified<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or let them hear, and say, "It is truth."</p>

    <p>10&emsp;"You are my witnesses," says the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and my servant whom I have chosen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Before me there was no god formed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall there be after me.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;I, even I, am the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and besides me there is no savior.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;I have declared, and have saved,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have shown,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when there was no strange god among you;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, you are my witnesses," says the LORD, "that I am God.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Even before the day was, I am he.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there is no one who can deliver out of my hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will work, and who shall hinder it?"</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Holy One of Israel:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"For your sake I have sent to Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have brought down all their nobles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;I am the LORD, your Holy One,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Creator of Israel, your King."</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a path in the mighty waters,</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Who brings forth the chariot and horse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the army and the power<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(they shall lie down together, they shall not rise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are extinct, they are quenched as tow):</p>

    <p>18&emsp;"Do not remember the former things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither consider the things of old.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Behold, I will do a new thing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now it shall spring forth. Shall you not know it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will even make a way in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rivers in the desert.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;The beast of the field shall honor me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the jackals and the owls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because I give waters in the <span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rivers in the desert<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to give drink to my people, my chosen.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;This people I have formed for myself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall show forth my praise.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you have been weary of me, O Israel.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;You have not brought me the small cattle of your burnt-offerings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have not caused you to serve with an offering,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor wearied you with incense.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;You have bought me no sweet cane with money,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you have made me to serve with your sins,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have wearied me with your iniquities.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not remember your sins.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;Put me in remembrance. Let us plead together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Declare, so that you may be justified.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;Your first father has sinned,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your teachers have transgressed against me.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;Therefore, I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have given Jacob to the curse<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel to reproaches."</p>
