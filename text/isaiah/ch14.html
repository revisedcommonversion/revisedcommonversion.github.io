  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob and will again choose Israel and set them in their own land. And the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 2 And the people shall take them and bring them to their place. And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for men-servants and women-servants. And they shall take them captives, whose captives they were, and they shall rule over their oppressors.</p>

  <p>3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD gives you rest from your sorrow, from your fear, and from the hard bondage in which you were made to serve, 4 That you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"How the oppressor has ceased!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The golden city ceased!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the scepter of the rulers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He who smote the people in wrath<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a continual stroke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he who ruled the nations in anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is persecuted, and no one hinders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The whole earth is at rest and is quiet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They break forth into singing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Even the fir-trees<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice at you, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Since you are laid down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />no feller has come up against us.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> All of them shall speak and say to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Have you also become weak as we are?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have you become like us?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> How you have fallen from heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O morning-star, son of the dawn!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How you are cut down to the ground,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who weakened the nations!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For you have said in your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I will ascend into heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also sit upon the mountain of the congregation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the uttermost parts of the north.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Yet you shall be brought down to hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the sides of the pit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Those who see you shall narrowly look upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and consider you, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Is this the man who made the earth to tremble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who shook kingdoms,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Who made the world as a wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroyed its cities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who did not open the house of his prisoners?'</p>

  <p>22 "For I will arise against them," says the LORD of hosts, "and cut off from Babylon the name, remnant, son, and nephew," says the LORD. 23 "I will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water. And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction," says the LORD of hosts.</p>

  <p>24 The LORD of hosts has sworn, saying, "Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass, and as I have purposed, so it shall stand. 25 I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot. Then his yoke shall depart from off them and his burden shall depart from off their shoulders. 26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth. And this is the hand that is stretched over all the nations. 27 For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who shall make it void? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/isaiah/MHC%20-%20Isaiah%2C%20Chapter%2014.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Isaiah, Chapter 14</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.12] - This is a verse of some controversy. The Latin Vulgate and early English texts have "Lucifer" in place of "morning-star." The Greek Septuagint has the word, <span class="gr-heb">εωσφόρος</span> (Heōsphóros), which is made up of two words: <span class="gr-heb">εωσ</span>, dawn, and <span class="gr-heb">φόρος</span>, to bear or carry. The Hebrew word used is, <span class="gr-heb">הֵילֵל</span> (hay-lale'), which means, morning-star. Lucifer is a Latin word that means morning-star, day-star, or bringer of light. It also refers to the planet Venus as the bright object in the sky in the morning, hence morning-star. Where the controversy arises is in the person of Lucifer. Many think Lucifer to be Satan, but this is not the case because of the context in which this passage resides. Here is some commentary from John Calvin:</p>
  <p>"The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance; for the context plainly shows that these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians. But when passages of Scripture are taken up at random, and no attention is paid to the context, we need not wonder that mistakes of this kind frequently arise. Yet it was an instance of very gross ignorance, to imagine that Lucifer was the king of devils, and that the Prophet gave him this name. But as these inventions have no probability whatever, let us pass by them as useless fables."</p>
  <p>Here is a passage from John Gill's Exposition:</p>
  <p>"O Lucifer, son of the morning! alluding to the star Venus, which is the phosphorus or morning star, which ushers in the light of the morning, and shows that day is at hand; by which is meant, not Satan, who is never in Scripture called Lucifer, though he was once an angel of light, and sometimes transforms himself into one, and the good angels are called morning stars (Job 38:7), and such he and his angels once were; but the king of Babylon is intended, whose royal glory and majesty, as outshining all the rest of the kings of the earth, is expressed by those names; and which perhaps were such as he took himself, or were given him by his courtiers."</p>
  <p>Here is the entry for <span class="gr-heb">הֵילֵל</span> in the Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew-English Lexicon:</p>
  <p>"<i>Noun masculine appellative.</i> Shining one, epithet of king of Babylon... Isaiah 14:12 <i>how art thou fallen, shinning one, son of dawn!</i> i.e. star of the morning."</p>
  <p>The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary applies this not only to the king of Babylon, but also to Antichrist. Here is the passage:</p>
  <p>"The language is so framed as to apply to the Babylonian king primarily, and at the same time to shadow forth through him, the great final enemy, the man of sin, Antichrist, of Daniel, St. Paul, and St. John; he alone shall fulfill exhaustively all the lineaments here given. [Verse] 12. Lucifer—'day star.' A title truly belonging to Christ (Revelation 22:16), 'the bright and morning star,' and therefore hereafter to be assumed by Antichrist."</p>
