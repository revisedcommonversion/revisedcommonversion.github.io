  <p>1 [<span class="it">The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And it shall come to pass in the last days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the mountain of the LORD'S house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be established on the top of the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall be exalted above the hills.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all nations shall flow to it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And many people shall go and say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the house of the God of Jacob.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he will teach us of his ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we will walk in his paths."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For out of Zion the law shall go forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And he will judge among the nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will rebuke many people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall beat their swords into plow-shares<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their spears into pruning-hooks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall they learn war anymore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O house of Jacob, come, and let us walk<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the light of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they are replenished from the east<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are soothsayers like the Philistines,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Their land is also full of silver and gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is there any end of their treasures.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their land is also full of horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is there any end of their chariots.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Their land is also full of idols.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They worship the work of their own hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that which their own fingers have made.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And the common man bows down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the great man humbles himself;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, do not forgive them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Enter into the rock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hide in the dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for fear of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the glory of his majesty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the haughtiness of men shall be abased,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For the day of the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be upon everyone who is proud and lofty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon everyone who is lifted up (and he shall be brought low),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And upon all the cedars of Lebanon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that are high and lifted up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And upon all the high mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And upon every high tower<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon every fortified wall,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And upon all the ships of Tarshish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon all pleasant pictures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And the loftiness of man shall be abased<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the haughtiness of men shall be made low,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And he will utterly abolish the idols.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And they shall go into the holes of the rocks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and into the caves of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for fear of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the glory of his majesty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he arises to shake the earth terribly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> In that day a man shall cast<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his idols of silver and his idols of gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which they made each one for himself to worship,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the moles and to the bats,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> To go into the clefts of the rocks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and into the tops of the ragged rocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for fear of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the glory of his majesty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he arises to shake the earth terribly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For what is he to be accounted of?</p>
