  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Who has believed our report?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a root out of a dry ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has no form nor majesty. And when we see him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He is despised and rejected by men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And like one from whom we hide our faces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he was despised, and we did not esteem him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet we esteemed him stricken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />smitten by God, and afflicted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> But he was wounded for our transgressions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He was bruised for our iniquities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The chastisement of our peace was upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> We have all like sheep gone astray.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have each turned to his own way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD has laid on him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the iniquity of us all.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He was oppressed and he was afflicted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet he did not open his mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a sheep before her shearers is mute,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so he did not open his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He was taken from prison and from judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who shall declare his generation?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For he was cut off from the land of the living.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the transgression of my people he was stricken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And he made his grave with the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the rich in his death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he had done no violence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has put him to grief.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When you make his soul an offering for sin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he shall see his offspring.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall prolong his days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the pleasure of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall prosper in his hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> He shall see of the travail of his soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall be satisfied.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />By his knowledge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my righteous servant shall justify many,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, I will divide to him a portion with the great,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall divide the plunder with the strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he has poured out his soul to death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he was numbered with the transgressors.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he bore the sin of many<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
