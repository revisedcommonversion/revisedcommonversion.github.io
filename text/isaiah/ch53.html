  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?</p>

  <p>2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground. He has no form nor majesty. And when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p>

  <p>3 He is despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And like one from whom we hide our faces, he was despised, and we did not esteem him.</p>

  <p>4 Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.</p>

  <p>5 But he was wounded for our transgression. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed.</p>

  <p>6 We have all like sheep gone astray. We have each turned to his own way, and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>

  <p>7 He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is mute, so he did not open his mouth.</p>

  <p>8 He was taken from prison and from judgment. And who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off from the land of the living. For the transgression of my people he was stricken.</p>

  <p>9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

  <p>10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him. He has put him to grief. When you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</p>

  <p>11 He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied. By his knowledge my righteous servant shall justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

  <p>12 Therefore, I will divide to him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he has poured out his soul to death and he was numbered with the transgressors. And he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
