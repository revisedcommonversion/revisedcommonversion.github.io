  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In that day the LORD with his keen, great, and strong sword will punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent. And he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>

  <p>2 In that day sing to her,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"A vineyard of red wine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I, the LORD, keep it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will water it every moment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Lest any hurt it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will keep it night and day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Fury is not in me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I would go through them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I would burn them together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Or let him take hold of my strength<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may make peace with me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall make peace with me."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He shall cause those who descend from Jacob to take root.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Israel shall blossom and bud<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fill the face of the world with fruit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Has he smitten him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as he smote those who smote him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or is he slain according to the slaughter<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of those who are slain by him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> In measure, when it shoots forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you will debate with it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He stays his rough wind<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the day of the east wind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> By this therefore, the iniquity of Jacob shall be purged,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and this is all the fruit to take away his sin:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he makes all the stones of the altar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like chalk-stones that are beaten apart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the groves and images shall not stand up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Yet the fortified city shall be desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There the calf shall feed, and there he shall lie down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and consume its branches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> When its boughs are withered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall be broken off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The women come and set them on fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it is a people of no understanding.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, he who made them will not have mercy on them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who formed them will show them no favor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the LORD shall gather<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the great trumpet shall be blown,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p>
