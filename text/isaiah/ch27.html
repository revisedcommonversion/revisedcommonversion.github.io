  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In that day the LORD with his keen, great, and strong sword will punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent. And he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>

  <p>2 In that day sing to her,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"A vineyard of red wine.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; I, the LORD, keep it. I will water it every moment. Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Fury is not in me. Who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would go through them. I would burn them together.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Or let him take hold of my strength so that he may make peace with me. And he shall make peace with me."</p>

    <p>6&emsp; He shall cause those who descend from Jacob to take root. Israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Has he smitten him, as he smote those who smote him? Or is he slain according to the slaughter of those who are slain by him?</p>

    <p>8&emsp; In measure, when it shoots forth, you will debate with it. He stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; By this therefore, the iniquity of Jacob shall be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin: when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk-stones that are beaten apart, the groves and images shall not stand up.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Yet the fortified city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness. There the calf shall feed, and there he shall lie down and consume its branches.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off. The women come and set them on fire, for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore, he who made them will not have mercy on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall gather from the channel of the river to the stream of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p>
