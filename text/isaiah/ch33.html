    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe to you destroyer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you were not laid waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you who deal treacherously,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they did not deal treacherously with you!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When you cease to lay waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall be wasted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when you make an end to deal treacherously,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall deal treacherously with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> O LORD, be gracious to us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have waited for you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Be their arm every morning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our salvation in the time of trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> At the noise of the tumult the people fled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At the lifting up of yourself the nations were scattered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And your plunder shall be gathered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the gathering of the ravaging-locust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As the running to and fro of locusts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he shall run upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strength of salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The fear of the LORD is his treasure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Behold, their valiant ones shall cry outside.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The highways lie waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the way-faring man ceases.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has broken the covenant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has despised the cities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He regards no man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The earth mourns and languishes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sharon is like a wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "Now I will rise," says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Now I will be exalted.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now I will lift up myself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> You shall conceive chaff.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall bring forth stubble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your breath, like a fire, shall devour you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And the people shall be like the burnings of lime.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You who are far off, hear what I have done.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you who are near, acknowledge my might."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The sinners in Zion are afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he who despises the gain of oppressions,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who shakes his hands from holding of bribes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who stops his ears from hearing about blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shuts his eyes from seeing evil,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He shall dwell on high.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His place of defense shall be the fortresses of rocks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bread shall be given to him. His waters shall be sure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Your heart shall meditate terror.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where is the scribe? Where is the receiver?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where is he who counted the towers?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> You shall not see a fierce people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a people of deeper speech than you can perceive,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a tabernacle that shall not be taken down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one of its stakes shall ever be removed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall any of its cords be broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> But there the glorious LORD will be for us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a place of broad rivers and streams,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which no galley with oars shall go,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall gallant ship pass through it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For the LORD is our judge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD is our lawgiver.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD is our king.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will save us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Your tacklings are loosened.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They could not well strengthen their mast.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They could not spread the sail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then the loot of a great plunder is divided.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lame take the plunder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And the inhabitants shall not say, "I am sick."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The people who dwell therein<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall have their iniquity forgiven.</p>
