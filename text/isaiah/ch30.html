    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Woe to the rebellious children," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"who take counsel, but not from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and who cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may add sin to sin,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Who walk to go down into Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not asked at my mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Therefore, the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and refuge in the shadow of Egypt your disgrace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For his princes were at Zoan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his ambassadors came to Hanes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They were all ashamed of a people who could not profit them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor be a help nor profit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a shame and also a reproach."</p>

    <p>6 [<span class="it">The burden of the beasts of the south.</span>]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Into the land of trouble and anguish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where the young and the old lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the viper and flying serpent come from,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their treasures upon the bunches of <span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a people who shall not profit them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For the Egyptian shall help in vain and to no purpose.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, I have cried concerning this, "Their strength is to sit still."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Now go, write it before them in a tablet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and note it in a book,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it may be for the time to come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />forever and ever,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> That this is a rebellious people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lying children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />children who will not hear the law of the LORD,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Who say to the seers, "Do not see,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the prophets, "Do not prophesy to us right things.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Speak to us smooth things. Prophesy deceits.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Withdraw from the way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Turn aside from the path.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cause the Holy One of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cease from before us."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Because you despise this word<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trust in oppression and perverseness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lean upon it,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose breaking comes suddenly at an instant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potter's vessel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that is broken in pieces. He shall not spare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that there shall not be found in its bursting a piece<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to take fire from the hearth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or to take water out of the pit."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"In returning and rest you shall be saved.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In quietness and in confidence your strength shall be."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you have not been willing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> But you said, "No, for we will flee upon horses."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, you shall flee.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you also said, "We will ride upon the swift."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, those who pursue you shall be swift.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At the rebuke of five you shall flee<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until you are left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as an ensign on a hill.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And therefore, the LORD will wait<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may be gracious to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and therefore, he will be exalted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may have mercy upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD is a God of judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed are all those who wait for him.</p>
  </div>

  <p>19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You shall no longer weep. He will be very gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears it, he will answer you. 20 And though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers will not be hidden anymore, but your eyes shall see your teachers. 21 And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, "This is the way, walk in it," when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left. 22 You shall also defile the covering of your engraved images of silver and the ornament of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as a polluted cloth. You shall say to it, "Be gone from me."</p>

  <p>23 Then he shall give the rain of your seed, with which you shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day your cattle shall feed in large pastures. 24 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that plow the ground shall eat clean provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 25 And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. 26 Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD binds up the breach of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />burning with his anger, and its burden is heavy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His lips are full of indignation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his tongue as a devouring fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And his breath, as an overflowing stream,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall reach to the midst of the neck,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> You shall have a song, as in the night, when a holy solemnity is kept,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to come upon the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall show the descent of his arm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the indignation of his anger, with the flame of a devouring fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with scattering, tempest, and hailstones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> For through the voice of the LORD the Assyrian shall be beaten down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who smote with a rod.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And in every place where the grounded staff passes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which the LORD lays upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it shall be with tambourines and harps.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And in battles of shaking he will fight with it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> For Tophet is ordained of old.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, for the king it is prepared.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has made it deep and large.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Its pile is fire and much wood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, kindles it.</p>
