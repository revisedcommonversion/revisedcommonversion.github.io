  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In those days Hezekiah was sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, "Thus says the LORD: 'Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.'" 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed to the LORD, 3 And said, "Remember now, O LORD, I implore you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p>

  <p>4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, 5 "Go and say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: "I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add to your days fifteen years. 6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. And I will defend this city."'</p>

  <p>7 "And this shall be a sign to you from the LORD that the LORD will do this thing that he has spoken: 8 Behold, I will bring back the shadow of the degrees, which has gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward." So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> I said, "In the cutting off of my days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall go to the gates of the grave.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am deprived of the remainder of my years."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I said, "I shall not see the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the LORD, in the land of the living.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall no longer behold man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the inhabitants of the world.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> O Lord, by these things men live,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in all these things is the life of my spirit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So you will recover me and make me to live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> For the grave cannot praise you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />death cannot celebrate you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who go down into the pit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />cannot hope for your truth.</p>

  <p>21 For Isaiah had said, "Let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover." 22 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?"</p>
