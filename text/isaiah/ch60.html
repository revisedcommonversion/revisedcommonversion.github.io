  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.</p>

  <p>2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people, but the LORD will arise upon you, and his glory will be seen upon you.</p>

  <p>3 And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.</p>

  <p>4 Lift up your eyes around and see. They all assemble themselves. They come to you. Your sons shall come from far and your daughters shall be nursed at your side.</p>

  <p>5 Then you shall see and flow together, and your heart shall fear and be enlarged, because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to you, the forces of the Gentiles shall come to you.</p>

  <p>6 The multitude of camels shall cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and incense and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.</p>

  <p>7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you. The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you. They shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.</p>

  <p>8 Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as doves to their windows?</p>

  <p>9 Surely the coastlands shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of the LORD your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.</p>

  <p>10 And the sons of strangers shall build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you, for in my wrath I smote you, but in my favor I have had mercy on you.</p>

  <p>11 Therefore, your gates shall be open continually. They shall not be shut day nor night, so that men may bring to you the forces of the Gentiles and that their kings may be brought.</p>

  <p>12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish. Indeed, those nations shall be utterly wasted.</p>

  <p>13 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box-tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary. And I will make the place of my feet glorious.</p>

  <p>14 The sons of those who afflicted you shall also come bending to you. And all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you, The City of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>

  <p>15 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated so that no man went through you, I will make you an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations.</p>

  <p>16 You shall also drink the milk of the Gentiles and shall nurse from the breast of kings. And you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.</p>

  <p>17 For brass I will bring gold, for iron I will bring silver, for wood, brass, and for stones, iron. I will also make your officers peace and your exactors righteousness.</p>

  <p>18 Violence shall no longer be heard in your land, wasting nor destruction within your borders, but you shall call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.</p>

  <p>19 The sun shall no longer be your light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you, but the LORD will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.</p>

  <p>20 Your sun shall go down no more, neither shall your moon withdraw itself, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.</p>

  <p>21 Your people shall also be all righteous. They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, so that I may be glorified.</p>

  <p>22 A little one shall become one thousand and a small one a strong nation. I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time."</p>
