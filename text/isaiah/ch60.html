    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Arise, shine, for your light has come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gross darkness the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD will arise upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his glory will be seen upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And the Gentiles shall come to your light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and kings to the brightness of your rising.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Lift up your eyes around and see.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They all assemble themselves. They come to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your sons shall come from far,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your daughters shall be nursed at your side.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Then you shall see and flow together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your heart shall fear and be enlarged,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the abundance of the sea shall be converted to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the forces of the Gentiles shall come to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The multitude of camels shall cover you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />dromedaries of Midian and Ephah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All those from Sheba shall come.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall bring gold and incense<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and show forth the praises of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall come up with acceptance on my altar,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will glorify the house of my glory.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Who are these who fly like a cloud,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like doves to their windows?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Surely the coastlands shall wait for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the ships of Tarshish first,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to bring your sons from far,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their silver and their gold with them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the name of the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the Holy One of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he has glorified you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And the sons of strangers shall build up your walls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their kings shall minister to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in my wrath I smote you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in my favor I have had mercy on you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Therefore, your gates shall be open continually.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall not be shut, day or night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that men may bring to you the forces of the Gentiles,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with their kings being led in procession.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, those nations shall be utterly wasted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the fir-tree, the pine-tree, and the box-tree together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to beautify the place of my sanctuary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will make the place of my feet glorious.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The sons of those who afflicted you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall also come bending to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all those who despised you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall bow themselves down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the soles of your feet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall call you, The City of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Whereas you have been forsaken and hated<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that no man went through you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make you an eternal excellence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a joy of many generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> You shall also drink the milk of the Gentiles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall nurse from the breast of kings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall know that I, the LORD, am your Savior<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For brass I will bring gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for iron I will bring silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for wood, brass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for stones, iron.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also make your officers peace<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your exactors righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Violence shall no longer be heard in your land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />wasting nor destruction within your borders,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall call your walls Salvation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your gates Praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The sun shall no longer be your light by day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD will be to you an everlasting light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your God will be your glory.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Your sun shall go down no more,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall your moon withdraw itself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD will be your everlasting light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the days of your mourning shall be ended.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Your people shall also be all righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall inherit the land forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may be glorified.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> A little one shall become a thousand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a small one a strong nation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time."</p>
