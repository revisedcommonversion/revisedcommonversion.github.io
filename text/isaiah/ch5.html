  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Now I will sing to my well-beloved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My well-beloved has a vineyard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in a very fruitful hill.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And he fenced it, gathered out its stones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />planted it with the choicest vine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />built a tower in the midst of it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made a wine-press therein.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he expected that it would bring forth grapes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it brought forth wild grapes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> What more could have been done to my vineyard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I have not done in it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why, when I expected that it would bring forth grapes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />did it bring forth wild grapes?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And now come. I will tell you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />what I will do to my vineyard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will take away its hedge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be eaten up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and break down its wall<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be trodden down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And I will lay it waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall not be pruned, nor dug,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but there shall come up briers and thorns.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also command the clouds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that they rain no rain upon it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he looked for judgment, but behold oppression,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for righteousness, but behold a cry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Woe to those who join house to house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who lay field to field<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until there is no place and you have been placed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />alone in the midst of the earth!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> In my ears the LORD of hosts said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Of a truth many houses shall be desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even great and fair, without inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Even ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Woe to those who rise early in the morning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may follow strong drink,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who continue until night<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until wine inflames them!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And the harp, the psaltery, the tambourine, pipe,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wine are in their feasts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they do not regard the work of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither consider the operation of his hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Therefore, my people have gone into captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have no knowledge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their honorable men are famished<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their multitude dried up with thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore, hell has enlarged herself<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and opened her mouth without measure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their glory, their multitude, their pomp,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who rejoices shall descend into it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And man shall be brought down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the mighty man shall be humbled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the eyes of the lofty shall be abased.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and God who is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Then the lambs shall feed after their manner,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strangers shall eat in the waste places of the fat ones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sin as with a cart-rope,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Who say, "Let him make speed and hasten his work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may see it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may know it!"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Woe to those who call evil good<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and good evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who put darkness for light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and light for darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who put bitter for sweet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sweet for bitter!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and prudent in their own sight!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and men of strength to mingle strong drink,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Who justify the wicked for reward<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the flame consumes the chaff,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so their root shall be as rottenness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their blossom shall go up as dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Therefore, the anger of the LORD is kindled against his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he has stretched forth his hand against them and has smitten them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the hills trembled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For all this his anger is not turned away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his hand is stretched out still.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from afar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will hiss to them from the end of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> None shall be weary nor stumble among them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and none shall slumber nor sleep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosened,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Whose arrows are sharp<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all their bows bent,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their horses' hooves shall be counted like flint<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their wheels like a whirlwind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Their roaring shall be like a lion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall roar like young lions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall even roar and lay hold of the prey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall carry it away safe,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall deliver it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> And in that day they shall roar against them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the roaring of the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if one looks to the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behold, darkness and sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the light is darkened in its heavens.</p>
