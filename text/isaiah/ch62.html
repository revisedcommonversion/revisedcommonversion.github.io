  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 For Zion's sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until its righteousness goes forth as brightness and its salvation as a lamp that burns.</p>

  <p>2 And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. And you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</p>

  <p>3 You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</p>

  <p>4 You shall no longer be termed Forsaken, neither shall your land be termed Desolate anymore, but you shall be called Hephzi-bah, and your land Beulah, for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.</p>

  <p>5 For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons shall marry you. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you.</p>

  <p>6 I have set watchmen upon your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night. You who make mention of the LORD, do not keep silent,</p>

  <p>7 And give him no rest, until he establishes and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p>

  <p>8 The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength, "Surely I will no longer give your corn to be food for your enemies, and the sons of the stranger shall not drink your wine for which you have labored,</p>

  <p>9 But those who have gathered it shall eat it and praise the LORD, and those who have collected it shall drink it in the courts of my holiness."</p>

  <p>10 Go through, go through the gates. Prepare the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the highway. Gather out the stones. Lift up a standard for the people.</p>

  <p>11 Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, "Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your salvation comes. Behold, his reward is with him and his work before him.'"</p>

  <p>12 And they shall call them, The Holy People, The Redeemed of the LORD. And you shall be called, Sought Out, A City not Forsaken.</p>
