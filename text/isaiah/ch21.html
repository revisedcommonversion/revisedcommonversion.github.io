  <p>1 [<span class="it">The burden of the desert of the sea.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">As whirlwinds in the south pass through,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; A grievous vision is declared to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The treacherous dealer deals treacherously and the destroyer destroys.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Go up, O Elam. Besiege, O Media.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All her sighing I have made to cease.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Therefore, my loins are filled with pain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman who travails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was bowed down when I heard it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was dismayed when I saw it.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; My heart panted, fearfulness terrified me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The night of my pleasure he has turned into fear for me.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; For thus the Lord has said to me:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a chariot of donkeys and a chariot of camels,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he listened diligently with much heed."</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Then he cried as a lion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"My lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I am set in my ward whole nights.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; And behold, here comes a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he answered and said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Babylon has fallen, has fallen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the engraved images of her gods he has broken to the ground."</p>

    <p>10&emsp;O my threshing and the grain of my floor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 [<span class="it">The burden of Dumah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">He calls to me out of Seir,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Watchman, what of the night?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Watchman, what of the night?"</p>

    <p>12&emsp;The watchman said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"The morning comes, and also the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If you will inquire, inquire. Return, come."</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 [<span class="it">The burden upon Arabia.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">In the forest in Arabia you shall lodge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O you traveling companies of Dedanim.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him who was thirsty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they met with their bread him who fled.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</p>
  </div>

  <p>16 For thus the Lord has said to me: "Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail. 17 And the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished. For the LORD God of Israel has spoken it."</p>
