  <p>1 [<span class="it">The burden of the desert of the sea.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">As whirlwinds in the south pass through,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so it comes from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> A grievous vision is declared to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The treacherous dealer deals treacherously,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the destroyer destroys.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Go up, O Elam. Besiege, O Media.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All her sighing I have made to cease.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Therefore, my loins are filled with pain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pangs have taken hold upon me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the pangs of a woman who travails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was bowed down when I heard it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was dismayed when I saw it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> My heart panted, fearfulness terrified me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The night of my pleasure<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he has turned into fear for me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Prepare the table,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />watch in the watch-tower,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />eat, drink.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, you princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and anoint the shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For thus the Lord has said to me:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Go, set a watchman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />let him declare what he sees.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a chariot of donkeys and a chariot of camels,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he listened diligently with much heed."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Then he cried like a lion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"My lord, I stand continually<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the watch-tower in the day time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I am set in my ward whole nights.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And behold, here comes a chariot of men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a couple of horsemen."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he answered and said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Babylon has fallen, has fallen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the engraved images of her gods<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he has broken to the ground."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> O my threshing and the grain of my floor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the God of Israel, I have declared to you.</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 [<span class="it">The burden of Dumah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">He calls to me out of Seir,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Watchman, what of the night?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Watchman, what of the night?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The watchman said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"The morning comes, and also the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If you will inquire, inquire. Return, come."</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 [<span class="it">The burden upon Arabia.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">In the forest in Arabia you shall lodge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O you traveling companies of Dedanim.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The inhabitants of the land of Tema<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />brought water to him who was thirsty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they met with their bread him who fled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For they fled from the swords,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the drawn sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the bent bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the grievousness of war.</p>
  </div>

  <p>16 For thus the Lord has said to me: "Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail. 17 And the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished. For the LORD God of Israel has spoken it."</p>
