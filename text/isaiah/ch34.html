    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Come near, you nations, to hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And listen, you people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the earth hear, and all that is in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the world, and all things that spring from it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his fury upon all their armies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has utterly destroyed them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has delivered them to the slaughter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Their slain shall also be cast out,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their ill smell shall come up from their carcasses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The mountains shall be melted with their blood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all their hosts shall fall down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the leaf falls from the vine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a falling fig from the fig-tree.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For my sword shall be bathed in heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, it shall come down upon Edom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the people of my curse to judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The sword of the LORD is filled with blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is made fat with fatness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the blood of lambs and goats,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the fat of the kidneys of rams.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And the wild oxen shall come down with them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the young bulls with the strong bulls.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their land shall be drenched with blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their dust made fat with fatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For it is the day of the LORD'S vengeance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the year of recompenses<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the controversy of Zion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And its streams shall be turned into pitch<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its dust into brimstone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its land shall become burning pitch.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> It shall not be quenched night nor day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Its smoke shall ascend forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From generation to generation it shall lie waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />None shall pass through it forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The owl and the raven shall dwell in it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall stretch out upon it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> They shall call her nobles to the kingdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but no one shall be there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all her princes shall be nothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And thorns shall come up in her palaces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nettles and brambles in her fortresses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be a habitation of jackals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a court for owls.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wolves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The screech-owl shall also rest there<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and find for herself a place of rest.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> There the great owl shall make her nest, lay,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hatch and gather under her shadow.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There the vultures shall also be gathered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each with her mate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Seek out of the book of the LORD, and read.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one of these shall fail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one shall lack her mate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For my mouth has commanded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his Spirit has gathered them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And he has cast the lot for them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his hand has divided it to them by line.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall possess it forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From generation to generation they shall dwell therein.</p>
