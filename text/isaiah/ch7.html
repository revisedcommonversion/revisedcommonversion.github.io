  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 2 And it was told to the house of David, saying, "Syria is confederated with Ephraim." And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</p>

  <p>3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go forth now to meet Ahaz—you and Shear-jashub your son—at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field, 4 And say to him, 'Take heed and be quiet. Do not fear, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria and of the son of Remaliah. 5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against you, saying, 6 "Let us go up against Judah and harass it, and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal," 7 Thus says the Lord GOD: "It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass. 8 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it is not a people. 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established."'"</p>

  <p>10 Moreover, the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, 11 "Ask for yourself a sign from the LORD your God. Ask it either in the depth, or in the height above." 12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I test the LORD." 13 And he said, "Hear now, O house of David. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? 14 Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. 15 He shall eat butter and honey, so that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you abhor shall be forsaken by both her kings.</p>

  <p>17 "The LORD will bring upon you, upon your people, and upon your father's house days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah, even the king of Assyria."</p>

  <p>18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 19 And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the desolate valleys, in the holes of the rocks, upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</p>

  <p>20 In the same day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired from beyond the river (namely, by the king of Assyria) the head and the hair of the feet. And it shall also consume the beard.</p>

  <p>21 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep. 22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat butter. For everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.</p>

  <p>23 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns. 24 Men shall come there with arrows and with bows, because all the land shall become briers and thorns. 25 And on all hills that are dug with the mattock, the fear of briers and thorns shall not come there, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle.</p>
