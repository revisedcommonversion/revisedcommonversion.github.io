  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Moreover, the LORD said to me, "Take a great scroll and write in it with a man's pen, 'Maher-shalal-hash-baz.'" 2 And I took for myself faithful witnesses to record: Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 4 For before the child has knowledge to cry, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria."</p>

  <p>5 The LORD also spoke to me again, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>6 "Because this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that flow gently and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</p>

    <p>7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory. And he shall come up over all its channels and go over all its banks.</p>

    <p>8 And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over. He shall reach even to the neck. And the extension of his wings shall fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.</p>

    <p>9 Associate yourselves, O people, and you shall be broken in pieces. And give ear, all you of far countries. Gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces. Gird yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces.</p>

    <p>10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing. Speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us."</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>12 "Do not say, 'A confederacy,' to all those to whom this people shall say, 'A confederacy,' neither fear their fear, nor be afraid.</p>

    <p>13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself, and let him be your fear and let him be your dread.</p>

    <p>14 And he will be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a trap and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>15 And many among them shall stumble, fall, be broken, be ensnared, and be taken."</p>
  </div>

  <p>16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 17 And I will wait upon the LORD, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. 18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts who dwells on mount Zion.</p>

  <p>19 And when they say to you, "Seek those who have familiar spirits, and wizards who peep, and who mutter," should a people not seek their God? On behalf of the living should they seek the dead? 20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. 21 And they shall pass through it distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass, that when they are hungry, they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their God and look upward. 22 And they shall look to the earth, and behold, trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish, and they shall be driven to darkness.</p>
