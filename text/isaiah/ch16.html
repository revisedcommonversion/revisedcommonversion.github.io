  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Send the lamb to the ruler of the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from Sela to the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; For it shall be,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so the daughters of Moab shall be<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the fords of Arnon.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Take counsel. Execute judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make your shadow as the night in the midst of the noon-day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Hide the outcasts. Do not discover him who wanders.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Be a covert to them from the face of the destroyer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the extortioner is at an end. Devastation ceases.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; And in mercy the throne shall be established.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />judging, seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; We have heard of the pride of Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that he is very proud,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even of his haughtiness, his pride, and his wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But his lies shall not be so.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Therefore, Moab shall howl for Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />everyone shall howl.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the foundations of Kir-hareseth you shall mourn.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely they are stricken.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; For the fields of Heshbon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the vine of Sibmah languish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lords of the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have broken down her principal plants.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have come even to Jazer<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they wandered through the wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her branches are extended,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have gone over the sea.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Therefore, I will wail with the weeping of Jazer<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the vine of Sibmah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will water you with my tears,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Heshbon and Elealeh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for on your summer fruits and on your harvest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the battle shout has fallen.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;And gladness and joy are taken away<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the plentiful field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the vineyards there shall be no singing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall there be shouting.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have made their vintage-shouting to cease.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Therefore, my heart shall sound like a harp for Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my inward parts for Kir-haresh.</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray, but he shall not prevail.</p>

  <p>13 This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning Moab since that time. 14 But now the LORD has spoken, saying, "Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be despised with all that great multitude, and the remnant shall be very small and feeble."</p>
