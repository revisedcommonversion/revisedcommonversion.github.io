    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Behold my servant, whom I uphold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my elect, in whom my soul delights.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have put my Spirit upon him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> He shall not cry, nor lift up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A bruised reed he shall not break,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the smoking flax he shall not quench.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall bring forth judgment to truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He shall not fail nor be discouraged<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until he has set judgment in the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the coastlands shall wait for his law."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Thus says God the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he who created the heavens and expanded them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he who spread forth the earth and that which it produces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he who gives breath to the people upon it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and spirit to those who walk therein:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will hold your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a light of the Gentiles,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> To open the blind eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to bring out the prisoners from the prison,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> I am the LORD. That is my name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will not give my glory to another,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither my praise to engraved images.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Behold, the former things have come to pass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and new things I declare.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Before they spring forth I tell you of them."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Sing to the LORD a new song,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his praise from the end of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the islands, and their inhabitants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the villages that Kedar inhabits.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the inhabitants of the rock sing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Let them give glory to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and declare his praise in the coastlands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The LORD will go forth as a mighty man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will stir up jealousy like a man of war.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will cry and even roar.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will prevail against his enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "I have long time held my peace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have been still and restrained myself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now I will cry like a travailing woman.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will destroy and devour at once.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> I will make waste mountains and hills<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dry up all their herbs.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will make the rivers to be islands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will dry up the pools.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And I will bring the blind by a way that they did not know.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will lead them in paths that they have not known.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will do these things for them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not forsake them."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who trust in engraved images,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who say to the molten images,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"You are our gods."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Hear, you deaf,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and look, you blind, so that you may see.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Who is blind, but my servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or deaf, as my messenger whom I sent?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is blind as he who is perfect,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and blind as the LORD'S servant?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Seeing many things, you do not observe.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Opening the ears, he does not hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will magnify the law and make it honorable.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> But this is a people robbed and pillaged.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All of them are snared in holes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they are hid in prison-houses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are for plunder, and no one delivers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for loot, and no one says, "Restore."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Who among you will give ear to this?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who will listen and hear for the time to come?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Who gave Jacob for plunder and Israel to the robbers?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was it not the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he against whom we have sinned?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they would not walk in his ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither were they obedient to his law.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Therefore, he has poured upon him the fury of his anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the strength of battle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It has set him on fire around, yet he did not know.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.</p>
