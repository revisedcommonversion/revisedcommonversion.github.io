  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my elect, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him. He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</p>

  <p>2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</p>

  <p>3 A bruised reed he shall not break, and the smoking flax he shall not quench. He shall bring forth judgment to truth.</p>

  <p>4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged until he has set judgment in the earth. And the coastlands shall wait for his law."</p>

  <p>5 Thus says God the LORD, he who created the heavens and expanded them, he who spread forth the earth and that which it produces, he who gives breath to the people upon it and spirit to those who walk therein:</p>

  <p>6 "I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles,</p>

  <p>7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison-house.</p>

  <p>8 I am the LORD. That is my name. And I will not give my glory to another, neither my praise to engraved images.</p>

  <p>9 Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare. Before they spring forth I tell you of them."</p>

  <p>10 Sing to the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, the islands, and their inhabitants.</p>

  <p>11 Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing. Let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>

  <p>12 Let them give glory to the LORD and declare his praise in the coastlands.</p>

  <p>13 The LORD will go forth as a mighty man, he will stir up jealousy like a man of war. He will cry and even roar. He will prevail against his enemies.</p>

  <p>14 "I have long time held my peace. I have been still and restrained myself. Now I will cry like a travailing woman. I will destroy and devour at once.</p>

  <p>15 I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs. And I will make the rivers to be islands, and I will dry up the pools.</p>

  <p>16 And I will bring the blind by a way that they did not know. I will lead them in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. I will do these things for them, and not forsake them."</p>

  <p>17 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, who trust in engraved images, who say to the molten images, "You are our gods."</p>

  <p>18 Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, so that you may see.</p>

  <p>19 Who is blind, but my servant, or deaf, as my messenger who I sent? Who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?</p>

  <p>20 Seeing many things, you do not observe. Opening the ears, he does not hear.</p>

  <p>21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake. He will magnify the law and make it honorable.</p>

  <p>22 But this is a people robbed and pillaged. All of them are snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses. They are for plunder, and no one delivers, for a spoil, and no one says, "Restore."</p>

  <p>23 Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?</p>

  <p>24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers? Was it not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.</p>

  <p>25 Therefore, he has poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle. It has set him on fire around, yet he did not know. It burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.</p>
