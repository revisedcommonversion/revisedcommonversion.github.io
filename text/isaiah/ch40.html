    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Comfort, comfort my people,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says your God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cry to her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that her warfare is accomplished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that her iniquity is pardoned,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for she has received from the LORD'S hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />double for all her sins."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The voice of him who cries in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Prepare the way of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make straight in the desert<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a highway for our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Every valley shall be exalted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />every mountain and hill shall be made low,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the crooked shall be made straight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rough places plain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all flesh together shall see it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The voice said, "Cry."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he said, "What shall I cry?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All flesh is grass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The grass withers, the flower fades,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the spirit of the LORD blows upon it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely the people are grass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The grass withers, the flower fades,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the word of our God shall stand forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> O Zion, who brings good tidings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />go up upon the high mountain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Jerusalem, who brings good tidings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lift up your voice with strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Lift it up, do not be afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Say to the cities of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold your God!"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Behold, the Lord GOD will come with a strong hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his arm will rule for him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, his reward is with him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his work before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> He will feed his flock like a shepherd.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will gather the lambs with his arm<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and carry them in his bosom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will gently lead those who are with young.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />measured heaven with the span,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or being his counselor has taught him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> With whom did he take counsel, and who instructed him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />taught him in the path of judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />taught him knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and showed to him the way of understanding?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are counted as the small dust of the balance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, he takes up the islands as a very little thing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> All nations before him are as nothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> To whom then will you compare God?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or what likeness will you compare to him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The workman melts an engraved image,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and casts silver chains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He who is so impoverished that he has no oblation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />chooses a tree that will not rot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He seeks for himself a skillful workman<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to prepare an engraved image that shall not be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Have you not known? Have you not heard?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has it not been told to you from the beginning?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> It is he who sits upon the circle of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its inhabitants are as locusts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who stretches out the heavens as a curtain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Who brings the princes to nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They have hardly been planted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have hardly been sown,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their stock has hardly taken root in the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and then he blows upon them and they wither,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> "To whom then will you compare me, or shall I be equaled?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Holy One.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Lift up your eyes on high<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold who has created these things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who brings out their host by number.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He calls them all by name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the greatness of his might, for he is strong in power.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one fails.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Why do you say, O Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and speak, O Israel, "My way is hid from the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my judgment is passed over by my God"?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Have you not known? Have you not heard,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the everlasting God, the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Creator of the ends of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />does not faint, neither is weary?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no searching of his understanding.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He gives power to the faint,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to those who have no might he increases strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Even the youths shall faint and be weary,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the young men shall utterly fall,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> But those who wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall mount up with wings as eagles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall run and not be weary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall walk and not faint.</p>
