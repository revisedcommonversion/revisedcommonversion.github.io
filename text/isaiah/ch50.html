    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom I have put away?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or which of my creditors is it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to whom I have sold you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, for your iniquities you have sold yourselves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for your transgressions your mother is put away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Why, when I came, was there no man?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why, when I called, was there no one to answer?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is my hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or have I no power to deliver?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I make the rivers a wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their fish become putrid because there is no water<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and die for thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I clothe the heavens with blackness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I make sackcloth their covering."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The Lord GOD has given me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the tongue of the learned,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He wakens morning by morning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he wakens my ear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to hear as the learned.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The Lord GOD opened my ear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was not rebellious,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither turned away backward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I gave my back to the smiters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For the Lord GOD will help me;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I shall not be confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, I have set my face like a flint,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He is near who justifies me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who will contend with me? Let us stand together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Behold the Lord GOD will help me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is he who shall condemn me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, all of them shall wax old as a garment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The moth shall eat them up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Who is among you who fears the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who obeys the voice of his servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who walks in darkness and has no light?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let him trust in the name of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rely upon his God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Behold, all you who kindle a fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who encompass yourselves with sparks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />walk in the light of your fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the sparks that you have kindled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This you shall have of my hand:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall lie down in sorrow.</p>
