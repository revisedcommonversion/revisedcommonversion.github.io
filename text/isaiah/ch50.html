  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1 Thus says the LORD: "Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities you have sold yourselves, and for your transgressions your mother is put away.</p>

    <p>2 Why, when I came, was there no man? Why, when I called, was there no one to answer? Is my hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilderness. Their fish become putrid because there is no water and die for thirst.</p>

    <p>3 I clothe the heavens with blackness and I make sackcloth their covering."</p>

    <p>4 The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, so that I should know how to speak a word in season to him who is weary. He wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned.</p>

    <p>5 The Lord GOD opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.</p>

    <p>6 I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair. I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.</p>

    <p>7 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore, I shall not be confounded. Therefore, I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>

    <p>8 He is near who justifies me. Who will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</p>

    <p>9 Behold the Lord GOD will help me. Who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all of them shall wax old as a garment. The moth shall eat them up.</p>

    <p>10 Who is among you who fears the LORD, who obeys the voice of his servant, who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD and rely upon his God.</p>

    <p>11 Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who encompass yourselves with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that you have kindled. This you shall have of my hand: you shall lie down in sorrow.</p>
