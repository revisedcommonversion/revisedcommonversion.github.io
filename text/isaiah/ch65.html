    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "I am sought by those who did not ask for me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am found by those who did not seek me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I said, 'Behold me, behold me,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a nation that was not called by my name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> I have spread out my hands all the day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a rebellious people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which walks in a way that is not good<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />after their own thoughts,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A people who provokes me to anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />continually to my face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who sacrifices in gardens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and burns incense upon altars of brick,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Who remain among the graves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lodge in the monuments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who eat swine's flesh<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Who say, 'Stand by yourself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not come near me, for I am holier than you.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />These are a smoke in my nose,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a fire that burns all the day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Behold, it is written before me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not keep silence, but will recompense,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even recompense into their bosom,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"who have burned incense upon the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and blasphemed me upon the hills.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, I will measure their former work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into their bosom."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"As the new wine is found in the cluster,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and one says, 'Do not destroy it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a blessing is in it,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so I will do for my servants' sake<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may not destroy them all.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And I will bring forth offspring out of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my elect shall inherit it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my servants shall dwell there.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for my people who have sought me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> But you are those who forsake the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who forget my holy mountain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who prepare a table for that troop,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and who furnish the drink-offering to that number.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, I will number you to the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall all bow down to the slaughter.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because when I called, you did not answer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I spoke, you did not hear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but did evil before my eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chose that in which I did not delight."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, my servants shall eat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall be hungry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, my servants shall drink,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall be thirsty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, my servants shall rejoice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Behold, my servants shall sing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for joy of heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall cry for sorrow of heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and howl for vexation of spirit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Lord GOD will slay you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and call his servants by another name,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> So that he who blesses himself in the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall bless himself in the God of truth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who swears in the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall swear by the God of truth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the former troubles are forgotten<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and because they are hid from my eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For behold, I create new heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a new earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the former shall not be remembered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor come into mind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> But be glad and rejoice forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in that which I create.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her people a joy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be glad in my people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the voice of crying.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> No longer shall there be from there an infant of days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor an old man who has not filled his days.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the child shall die at a hundred years old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And they shall build houses and inhabit them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> They shall not build and another inhabit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall not plant and another eat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For as the days of a tree are the days of my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> They shall not labor in vain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor bring forth for trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are a people blessed by the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their offspring with them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And it shall come to pass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that before they call, I will answer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and while they are still speaking, I will hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the lion shall eat straw like the bull,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dust shall be the serpents' food.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall not hurt nor destroy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in all my holy mountain,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
