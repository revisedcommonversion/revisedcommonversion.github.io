    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Listen to me, O islands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and listen, you people, from far.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD has called me from the womb.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From the body of my mother<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he has made mention of my name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the shadow of his hand he has hid me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He made me a polished shaft,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in his quiver he has hid me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And he said to me, "You are my servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Israel, in whom I will be glorified."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Then I said, "I have labored in vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have spent my strength for nothing and in vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet surely my judgment is with the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my work with my God."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And now, the LORD says,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who formed me from the womb to be his servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to bring Jacob back to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though Israel is not gathered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my God shall be my strength),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And he said, "It is a light thing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you should be my servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to raise up the tribes of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to restore the preserved of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also give you as a light to the Gentiles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may be my salvation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the end of the earth."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to him whom man despises,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to him whom the nation abhors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a servant of rulers:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Kings shall see and arise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />princes also shall worship,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the LORD who is faithful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"In an acceptable time I have heard you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in a day of salvation I have helped you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will preserve you and give you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a covenant to the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to establish the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cause to inherit the desolate heritages,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> So that you may say to the prisoners, 'Go forth,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to those who are in darkness, 'Show yourselves.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall feed in the ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their pastures shall be in all high places.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They shall neither hunger nor thirst,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the heat or sun smite them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he who has mercy on them shall lead them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even by the springs of water he shall guide them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And I will make all my mountains a way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my highways shall be exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Behold, these shall come from far.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And behold, these from the north and from the west,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and these from the land of Sinim."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Sing, O heavens, and be joyful, O earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and break forth into singing, O mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has comforted his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my Lord has forgotten me."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> "Can a woman forget her nursing child,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that she should not have compassion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on the son of her womb?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even they may forget,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet I will not forget you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Behold, I have engraved you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the palms of my hands.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your walls are continually before me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Your children shall make haste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your destroyers and those who made you waste<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall go forth from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Lift up your eyes around and behold.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All these assemble themselves and come to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As I live," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"you shall surely clothe yourself with them all<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with an ornament,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bind them on yourself<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a bride does.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> For your waste and your desolate places<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the land of your destruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall even now be too narrow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by reason of the inhabitants.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who swallowed you up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be far away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The children which you shall have,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />after you have lost the other,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall say again in your ears,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'The place is too narrow for me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give place to me so that I may dwell.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Then you shall say in your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Who has begotten these for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />seeing I have lost my children and am desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a captive, and wandering to and fro?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who has brought these up?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, I was left alone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />These, where have they been?'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Thus says the Lord GOD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set up my standard to the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall bring your sons in their arms,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And kings shall be your nursing fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their queens your nursing mothers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall bow to you with their face toward the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lick up the dust of your feet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall know that I am the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall not be ashamed who wait for me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the lawful captive delivered?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> But thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will contend with him who contends with you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will save your children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be drunken with their own blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with sweet wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all flesh shall know<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I, the LORD, am your Savior<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your Redeemer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the mighty One of Jacob."</p>
