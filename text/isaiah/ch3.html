  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the rod and the staff,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the whole support of bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the whole support of water,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The mighty man, the man of war,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the judge, the prophet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the prudent, the ancient,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The captain of fifty, the honorable man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the counselor, the skillful craftsman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the eloquent orator.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And I will give children to be their princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and babies shall rule over them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And the people shall be oppressed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each by another and each by his neighbor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The child shall behave himself proudly against the elder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the base against the honorable.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> When a man takes hold of his brother<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the house of his father, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"You have clothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />be our ruler,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let this ruin be under your hand,"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> In that day he shall swear, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I will not be a healer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not make me a ruler of the people."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For Jerusalem is ruined<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Judah has fallen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The show of their countenance witnesses against them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they declare their sin as Sodom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not hide it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Woe to their soul!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they have rewarded evil to themselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Say to the righteous that it shall be well with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the reward of his hands shall be given to him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> As for my people, children are their oppressors<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and women rule over them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O my people, those who lead you cause you to err<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy the way of your paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The LORD stands up to plead<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stands to judge the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The LORD will enter into judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the elders of his people and with their princes:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"For you have eaten up the vineyard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The plunder of the poor is in your houses."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The Lord GOD of hosts says,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"What do you mean that you beat my people to pieces<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and grind the faces of the poor?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Moreover, the LORD says,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Because the daughters of Zion are haughty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and walk with extended necks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wanton eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />walking with short steps as they go<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and making a tinkling with their feet,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD will uncover their secret parts."</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 In that day the Lord will take away the show of their tinkling ornaments around their feet, their headwear, their crescents, 19 The chains, the bracelets, the veils, 20 The caps, the ornaments of the legs, the head-bands, the perfume boxes, the amulets, 21 The rings, nose-jewels, 22 The changeable suits of apparel, the mantles, the cloaks, the purses, 23 The mirrors, the fine linen, the hoods, and the veils.</p>

  <p>24 And it shall come to pass, that,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and instead of a girdle, a rent;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and instead of well set hair, baldness;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and instead of a mantle, a girding of sackcloth;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and burning instead of beauty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Your men shall fall by the sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your mighty in the war.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And her gates shall lament and mourn.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And being desolate, she shall sit upon the ground.</p>
