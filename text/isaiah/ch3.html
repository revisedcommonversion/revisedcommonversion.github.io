  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 For behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah the rod and the staff, the whole support of bread, the whole support of water,</p>

  <p>2 The mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet, the prudent, the ancient,</p>

  <p>3 The captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor, the skillful craftsman, and the eloquent orator.</p>

  <p>4 And I will give children to be their princes, and babies shall rule over them.</p>

  <p>5 And the people shall be oppressed, each by another and each by his neighbor. The child shall behave himself proudly against the elder, and the base against the honorable.</p>

  <p>6 When a man takes hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, "You have clothing, be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand,"</p>

  <p>7 In that day he shall swear, saying, "I will not be a healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing. Do not make me a ruler of the people."</p>

  <p>8 For Jerusalem is ruined and Judah has fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>

  <p>9 The show of their countenance witnesses against them. And they declare their sin as Sodom. They do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have rewarded evil to themselves.</p>

  <p>10 Say to the righteous that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>

  <p>11 Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given to him.</p>

  <p>12 As for my people, children are their oppressors and women rule over them. O my people, those who lead you cause you to err and destroy the way of your paths.</p>

  <p>13 The LORD stands up to plead and stands to judge the people.</p>

  <p>14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and with their princes: "For you have eaten up the vineyard. The plunder of the poor is in your houses."</p>

  <p>15 The Lord GOD of hosts says, "What do you mean that you beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor?"</p>

  <p>16 Moreover, the LORD says, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with extended necks and wanton eyes, walking with short steps as they go and making a tinkling with their feet,</p>

  <p>17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will uncover their secret parts."</p>

  <p>18 In that day the Lord will take away the show of their tinkling ornaments around their feet, their headwear, their crescents, 19 The chains, the bracelets, the veils, 20 The caps, the ornaments of the legs, the head-bands, the perfume boxes, the amulets, 21 The rings, nose-jewels, 22 The changeable suits of apparel, the mantles, the cloaks, the purses, 23 The mirrors, the fine linen, the hoods, and the veils.</p>

  <p>24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be an offensive odor; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a mantle, a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</p>

  <p>25 Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty in the war.</p>

  <p>26 And her gates shall lament and mourn. And being desolate, she shall sit upon the ground.</p>
