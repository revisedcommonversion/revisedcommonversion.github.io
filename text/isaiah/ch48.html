  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Hear this, O house of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who are called by the name of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have come forth out of the waters of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who swear by the name of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make mention of the God of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but not in truth nor in righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For they call themselves of the holy city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stay themselves upon the God of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I have declared the former things from the beginning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they went forth from my mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I proclaimed them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I did them suddenly<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they came to pass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Because I knew that you are obstinate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow brass,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I have even from the beginning declared it to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Before it came to pass I showed it to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest you should say, 'My idol has done them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my engraved image and my molten image<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has commanded them.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You have heard it. See all of this.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And will you not declare it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have showed you new things from this time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even hidden things, and you did not know them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They are created now, and not from the beginning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even before the day when you did not hear them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest you should say, 'Behold, I knew them.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Indeed, you did not hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, you did not know.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, from that time your ear was not opened.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I knew that you would deal very treacherously<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and were called a transgressor from the womb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For my name's sake I will defer my anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for my praise I will refrain for you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I do not cut you off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For my own sake, even for my own sake, I will do it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For how should my name be profaned?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will not give my glory to another.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Listen to me, O Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel my called.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am he. I am the first.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am also the last.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> My hand has also laid the foundation of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my right hand has spanned the heavens.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I call to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they stand up together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> All of you, assemble yourselves and hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who among them has declared these things?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD has loved him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will do his pleasure on Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> I, even I, have spoken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, I have called him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have brought him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall make his way prosperous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Come near to me. Hear this.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have not spoken in secret from the beginning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From the time that it was, there I am.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And now the Lord GOD and his Spirit has sent me."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Holy One of Israel:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I am the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who teaches you to profit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who leads you by the way that you should go.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> O that you had listened to my commandments!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then your peace would have been like a river<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Your descendants also would have been like the sand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the offspring of your body like its grains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His name should not have been cut off<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor destroyed from before me."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Go forth from Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Flee from the Chaldeans.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With a voice of singing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />declare, tell this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and utter it even to the end of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And they did not thirst<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he led them through the deserts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He also cleaved the rock and the waters gushed out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "There is no peace,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD, "for the wicked."</p>
