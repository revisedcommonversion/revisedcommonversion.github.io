  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Awake, awake, put on your strength, O Zion. Put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city. For from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come into you.</p>

  <p>2 Shake yourself from the dust. Arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem. Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p>

  <p>3 For thus says the LORD: "You have sold yourselves for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money." 4 For thus says the Lord GOD: "My people went down formerly into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 5 Now therefore, what do I have here," says the LORD, "that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them make them to howl," says the LORD, "and my name continually every day is blasphemed. 6 Therefore, my people shall know my name. Therefore, they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks, 'Behold, it is I.'"</p>

  <p>7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good tidings, who publishes peace, who brings good tidings of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"</p>

  <p>8 Your watchmen shall lift up their voices. With their voices together they shall sing, for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD brings back Zion.</p>

  <p>9 Break forth into joy, sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>10 The LORD has made his holy arm bare in the eyes of all the nations. And all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p>

  <p>11 Depart, depart, go out from there. Touch no unclean thing. Go out of the midst of her. Be clean, you who bear the vessels of the LORD.</p>

  <p>12 For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight, for the LORD will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear-ward.</p>

  <p>13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently. He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>

  <p>14 As many were astonished at you (his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),</p>

  <p>15 So he shall sprinkle many nations. The kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told to them they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall consider.</p>
