    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Awake, awake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />put on your strength, O Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Put on your beautiful garments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Jerusalem, the holy city.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall no longer come into you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Shake yourself from the dust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Release yourself from the bonds of your neck,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O captive daughter of Zion.</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 For thus says the LORD: "You have sold yourselves for nothing, and you shall be redeemed without money." 4 For thus says the Lord GOD: "My people went down formerly into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 5 Now therefore, what do I have here," says the LORD, "that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them make them to howl," says the LORD, "and my name continually every day is blasphemed. 6 Therefore, my people shall know my name. Therefore, they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks, 'Behold, it is I.'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> How beautiful upon the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are the feet of him who brings good tidings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who publishes peace, who brings good tidings of good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who publishes salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who says to Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Your God reigns!"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Your watchmen shall lift up their voices.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With their voices together they shall sing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall see eye to eye,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the LORD brings back Zion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Break forth into joy, sing together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you waste places of Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has comforted his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he has redeemed Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The LORD has made his holy arm bare<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the eyes of all the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all the ends of the earth shall see<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the salvation of our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Depart, depart, go out from there.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Touch no unclean thing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Go out of the midst of her. Be clean,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who bear the vessels of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For you shall not go out with haste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor go by flight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD will go before you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the God of Israel will be your rear-ward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> As many were astonished at you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(his visage was so marred more than any man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his form more than the sons of men),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> So he shall sprinkle many nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The kings shall shut their mouths at him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for that which had not been told to them they shall see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which they had not heard they shall consider.</p>
