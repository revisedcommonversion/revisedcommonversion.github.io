    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"The heaven is my throne<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the earth is my footstool.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where is the house that you build for me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where is the place of my rest?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For all these things my hand has made,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all these things have been,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"But to this man I will look,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trembles at my word.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He who kills an ox is as if he slew a man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who sacrifices a lamb is as if he cut off a dog's neck.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who offers an oblation is as if he offered swine's blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, they have chosen their own ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their soul delights in their abominations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I will also choose their delusions<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will bring their fears upon them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because when I called, no one answered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I spoke, they did not hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they did evil before my eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chose that in which I did not delight."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Hear the word of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who tremble at his word:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Your brothers who hated you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who cast you out for my name's sake, said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Let the LORD be glorified,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he shall appear to your joy,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> A voice of noise from the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a voice from the temple,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[it is] the voice of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who renders recompense to his enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Before she travailed, she brought forth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Before her pain came,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she had delivered a male child.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Who has heard such a thing?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has seen such things?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or shall a nation be born at once?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For as soon as Zion travailed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she brought forth her children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Shall I bring to the birth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not cause to bring forth?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Shall I cause to bring forth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shut the womb?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says your God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "Rejoice with Jerusalem<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be glad with her, all you who love her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Rejoice for joy with her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all you who mourn for her,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> So that you may nurse and be satisfied<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the breasts of her consolations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may draw milk and be delighted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the abundance of her glory."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then you shall nurse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall be borne upon her sides<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be dandled upon her knees.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> As one whom his mother comforts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so I will comfort you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your bones shall flourish like an herb.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his indignation toward his enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For behold, the LORD will come with fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with his chariots like a whirlwind<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to render his anger with fury<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For by fire and by his sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD will plead with all flesh.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the slain of the LORD shall be many.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> "Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the gardens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behind one tree in the midst,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />eating swine's flesh, the abomination, and the mouse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be consumed together,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 "For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come, that I will gather all nations and languages, and they shall come and see my glory. 19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations—to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the coastlands afar off—who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 20 And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations upon horses, in chariots, in litters, upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem," says the LORD, "as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. 21 And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites," says the LORD.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "For as the new heavens and the new earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which I will make,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall remain before me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"so your descendants and your name shall remain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And it shall come to pass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that from one new moon to another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from one sabbath to another,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all flesh shall come to worship before me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> "And they shall go forth and look<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the carcasses of the men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have transgressed against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For their worm shall not die,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall their fire be quenched,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."</p>
