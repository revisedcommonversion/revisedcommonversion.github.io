  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose glorious beauty is a fading flower,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who are on the head of the rich valleys of those who are overcome with wine!</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As a tempest of hail and a destroying storm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a flood of mighty waters overflowing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he shall cast down to the earth with the hand.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be trodden under feet.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; And the glorious beauty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which is on the head of the rich valley,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be a fading flower and as the early fruit before the summer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which he who looks upon it sees,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; In that day the LORD of hosts will be<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the remnant of his people,</p>

    <p>6&emsp; And for a spirit of judgment to him who sits in judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for strength to those who turn the battle to the gate.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; But they also have erred through wine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and through strong drink are out of the way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are overwhelmed with wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are out of the way through strong drink.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that there is no clean place.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Whom shall he teach knowledge?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And whom shall he make to understand doctrine?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who are weaned from the milk<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drawn from the breasts.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />line upon line, line upon line,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />here a little, and there a little.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;For with stammering lips and another language<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will speak to this people,</p>

    <p>12&emsp;To whom he said, "This is the rest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with which you may cause the weary to rest,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and, "This is the refreshing,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they would not hear.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;But the word of the LORD was to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />precept upon precept, precept upon precept,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />line upon line, line upon line,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />here a little, and there a little,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they might go and fall backward and be broken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />snared, and taken.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Because you have said, "We have made a covenant with death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we are in agreement with hell.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the overflowing scourge passes through,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it shall not reach us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for we have made lies our refuge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and under falsehood we have hid ourselves,"</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I lay a stone in Zion for a foundation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who believes shall not make haste.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;I will also lay judgment to the line<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and righteousness to the plummet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;And your covenant with death shall be made void<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your agreement with hell shall not stand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the overflowing scourge passes through,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall be trodden down by it.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;From the time that it goes forth it shall take you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For morning by morning it shall pass over,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by day and by night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And it shall be a vexation only to understand the report."</p>

    <p>20&emsp;For the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the covering narrower than he can wrap himself in.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;For the LORD will rise as on mount Perazim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may do his work, his strange work,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Now therefore, do not be mockers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest your bonds be made strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even determined upon the whole earth.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;Give ear and hear my voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Listen and hear my speech.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Does the plowman plow all day to sow?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Does he open and break the clods of his ground?</p>

    <p>25&emsp;When he has made even its face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />does he not cast abroad the vetches, scatter the cumin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />cast in the principal wheat, the appointed barley,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the spelt in their place?</p>

    <p>26&emsp;For his God instructs himto discretion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and teaches him.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;For the vetches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is a cart-wheel turned around upon the cumin.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the vetches are beaten out with a staff<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the cumin with a rod.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;Bread-grain is bruised,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he will not always be threshing it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor break it with the wheel of his cart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor bruise it with his horsemen.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in operation.</p>
