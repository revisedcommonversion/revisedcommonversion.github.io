  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Add year to year.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them kill sacrifices.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Yet I will distress Ariel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there shall be heaviness and sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be to me as Ariel.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; And I will encamp against you all around,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will lay siege against you with siege-works<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and raise forts against you.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; And you shall be brought down and shall speak out of the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your speech shall be low out of the dust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your voice shall be, as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Moreover, the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall even be at an instant, suddenly.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; You shall be visited by the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with thunder, with an earthquake, with great noise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with storm and tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even all who fight against her and her fortress, and who distress her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be as a dream of a night-vision.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he awakes and his soul is empty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he awakes, and behold, he is faint and his soul has appetite.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus the multitude of all the nations shall be who fight against mount Zion.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Stay yourselves, and wonder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cry out, and cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are drunken, but not with wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They stagger, but not with strong drink.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For the LORD has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has closed your eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The prophets and your rulers, the seers he has covered.</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 And the vision of all has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is learned, saying, "Read this, I pray you," and he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed." 12 And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, "Read this, I pray you," and he says, "I am not learned."</p>

  <p>13 Therefore, the Lord said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Because this people draw near to me with their mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and honor me with their lips,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but have removed their heart far from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men,</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even an astonishing work and a wonder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid."</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their works are in the dark<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they say, "Who sees us?" and, "Who knows us?"</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For shall the work say of him who made it, "He did not make me"?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or shall the thing framed say of him who framed it, "He had no understanding"?</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Is it not yet a very little while,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>

    <p>18&emsp;And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;The meek shall also increase their joy in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;For the terrible one is brought to nothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the scoffer is consumed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all who watch for iniquity are cut off,</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Who make a man an offender for a word,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Therefore, thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Jacob shall not now be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall his face now become pale.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall sanctify my name<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall fear the God of Israel.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Those who also erred in spirit shall come to understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who murmured shall learn doctrine."</p>
