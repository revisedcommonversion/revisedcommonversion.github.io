  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Add year to year.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them kill sacrifices.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Yet I will distress Ariel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there shall be heaviness and sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be to me as Ariel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And I will encamp against you all around,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will lay siege against you with siege-works<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and raise forts against you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And you shall be brought down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall speak out of the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your speech shall be low out of the dust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your voice shall be out of the ground,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like one who has a familiar spirit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Moreover, the multitude of your strangers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be like small dust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the multitude of the terrible ones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be like chaff that passes away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall even be at an instant, suddenly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You shall be visited by the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with thunder, with an earthquake, with great noise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with storm and tempest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the flame of devouring fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And the multitude of all the nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who fight against Ariel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even all who fight against her and her fortress,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and who distress her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be like a dream of a night-vision.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> It shall even be as when a hungry man dreams,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold, he eats,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he awakes and his soul is empty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or as when a thirsty man dreams,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold, he drinks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he awakes, and behold, he is faint<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his soul has appetite.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus the multitude of all the nations shall be<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who fight against mount Zion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Stay yourselves, and wonder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cry out, and cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are drunken, but not with wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They stagger, but not with strong drink.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For the LORD has poured out upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the spirit of deep sleep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has closed your eyes (the prophets),<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he has covered your heads (the seers).</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 And the vision of all has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is learned, saying, "Read this, I pray you," and he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed." 12 And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, "Read this, I pray you," and he says, "I am not learned."</p>

  <p>13 Therefore, the Lord said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Because this people draw near to me with their mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and honor me with their lips,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but have removed their heart far from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among this people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even an astonishing work and a wonder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Woe to those who seek deep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to hide their counsel from the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their works are in the dark<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they say, "Who sees us?" and, "Who knows us?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Surely your turning of things upside down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be esteemed as the potter's clay.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For shall the work say of him who made it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"He did not make me"?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or shall the thing framed say of him who framed it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"He had no understanding"?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Is it not yet a very little while,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And in that day the deaf shall hear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the words of the book,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the eyes of the blind shall see<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of obscurity and out of darkness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The meek shall also increase their joy in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the poor among men shall rejoice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> For the terrible one is brought to nothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the scoffer is consumed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all who watch for iniquity are cut off,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Who make a man an offender for a word,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.</p>
  </div>

    <p>22 Therefore, thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Jacob shall not now be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall his face now become pale.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> But when he sees his children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of my hands, in the midst of him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall sanctify my name<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall fear the God of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Those who also erred in spirit shall come to understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who murmured shall learn doctrine."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.10a] - "the prophets... the seers" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "It is reasonably conjectured that the expressions, 'the prophets,' 'the seers,' are glosses, which have crept from the margin into the text... If so, they are probably mistaken glosses, the allusion being, not to particular classes, but to the actual 'heads' and 'eyes' of individual Hebrews, which were 'closed' and 'covered' by the judicial action of the Almighty. In the East a covering is often drawn over the head during sleep."</p>
  <p>[v.10b] - Quoted in Romans 11:8.</p>
  <p>[v.13] - Quoted in Matthew 15:8-9; Mark 7:6-7.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - Quoted in 1st Corinthians 1:19.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - Reference, Matthew 11:5; Luke 7:22.</p>
