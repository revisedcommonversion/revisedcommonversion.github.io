  <p>1 [<span class="it">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth. For the LORD has spoken, "I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>

  <p>3 The ox knows his owner and the donkey his master's crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not consider."</p>

  <p>4 Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children who are corrupters. They have forsaken the LORD. They have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger. They have gone away backward.</p>

  <p>5 Why should you be stricken anymore? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick and the whole heart is faint.</p>

  <p>6 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds, bruises, and putrefying sores. They have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>

  <p>7 Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Your land, strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>

  <p>8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>

  <p>9 Unless the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</p>

  <p>10 Hear the word of the LORD, rulers of Sodom. Give ear to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts, and I do not delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs, or of male goats.</p>

  <p>12 When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand to tread my courts?</p>

  <p>13 Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination to me. The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure. It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>

  <p>14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They are a trouble to me. I am weary to bear them.</p>

  <p>15 And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Indeed, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</p>

  <p>16 Wash, make yourselves clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.</p>

  <p>17 Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow.</p>

  <p>18 "Come now and let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>

  <p>19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land,</p>

  <p>20 But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."</p>

  <p>21 How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of judgment and righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.</p>

  <p>22 Your silver has become dross and your wine mixed with water.</p>

  <p>23 Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves gifts and follows after rewards. They do not judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</p>

  <p>24 Therefore, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, says, "Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries and avenge myself of my enemies.</p>

  <p>25 And I will turn my hand upon you and thoroughly purge away your dross and take away all your tin.</p>

  <p>26 And I will restore your judges as at the first and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward, you shall be called, The City of Righteousness, The Faithful City."</p>

  <p>27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness.</p>

  <p>28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>

  <p>29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</p>

  <p>30 For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades and as a garden that has no water.</p>

  <p>31 And the strong shall be as tow and its maker as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and no one shall quench them.</p>
