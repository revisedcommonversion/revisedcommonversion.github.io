  <p>1 [<span class="it">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the LORD has spoken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I have nourished and brought up children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they have rebelled against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The ox knows his owner<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the donkey his master's crib,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but Israel does not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my people do not consider."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Ah, sinful nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a people laden with iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />offspring of evil-doers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />children who are corrupters.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have forsaken the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have gone away backward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Why should you be stricken anymore?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You will revolt more and more.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The whole head is sick<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the whole heart is faint.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> From the sole of the foot even to the head<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there is no soundness in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but wounds, bruises, and putrefying sores.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have not been closed, neither bound up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither mollified with ointment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Your country is desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your cities are burned with fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your land, strangers devour it in your presence<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And the daughter of Zion is left<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a cottage in a vineyard,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a besieged city.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Unless the LORD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />had left to us a very small remnant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />we should have been as Sodom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />we should have been like Gomorrah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Hear the word of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />rulers of Sodom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give ear to the law of our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />people of Gomorrah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The LORD says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fat of fed beasts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I do not delight in the blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of bulls, of lambs, or of male goats.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> When you come to appear before me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has required this at your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to tread my courts?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Bring no more vain oblations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incense is an abomination to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I cannot endure. It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Your new moons and your appointed feasts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my soul hates.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are a trouble to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am weary to bear them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And when you spread forth your hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will hide my eyes from you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, when you make many prayers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your hands are full of blood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Wash, make yourselves clean.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Put away the evil of your doings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from before my eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cease to do evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Learn to do well.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seek judgment. Relieve the oppressed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> "Come now and let us reason together," says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Though your sins are as scarlet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall be white as snow.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though they are red like crimson,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall be as wool.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> If you are willing and obedient,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall eat the good of the land,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> But if you refuse and rebel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall be devoured with the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> How the faithful city<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has become a harlot!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It was full of judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and righteousness lodged in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but now murderers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Your silver has become dross<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your wine mixed with water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Your princes are rebellious<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and companions of thieves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone loves gifts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and follows after rewards.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not judge the fatherless,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Therefore, the Lord, the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the mighty One of Israel, says,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and avenge myself of my enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> And I will turn my hand upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and thoroughly purge away your dross<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take away all your tin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And I will restore your judges as at the first<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your counselors as at the beginning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Afterward, you shall be called,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The City of Righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Faithful City."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her converts with righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a garden that has no water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> And the strong shall be as tow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its maker as a spark,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall both burn together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall quench them.</p>
