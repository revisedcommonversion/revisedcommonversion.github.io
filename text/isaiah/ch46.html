  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Bel bows down and Nebo stoops. Their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle. Your loads were heavy. They were a burden to the weary beast.</p>

  <p>2 They stoop. They bow down together. They could not deliver the burden, but they themselves have gone into captivity.</p>

  <p>3 "Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the birth, which are carried from the womb.</p>

  <p>4 And even to your old age I am he. And even to hoary hairs I will carry you. I have made and I will bear. I will even carry and will deliver you.</p>

  <p>5 To whom will you compare me and make me equal, and compare me so that we may be alike?</p>

  <p>6 They lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith and he makes it a god. They fall down and they even worship.</p>

  <p>7 They bear him upon the shoulder. They carry him and set him in his place and he stands. From his place he shall not remove. Indeed, one shall cry to him, yet he cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</p>

  <p>8 Remember this, and show yourselves men. Bring it back to mind, O transgressors.</p>

  <p>9 Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is no one else. I am God, and there is no one like me,</p>

  <p>10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;'</p>

  <p>11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man who executes my counsel from a far country. I have spoken it and I will also bring it to pass. I have purposed it and I will also perform it.</p>

  <p>12 Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness.</p>

  <p>13 I bring my righteousness near. It shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay. And I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory."</p>
