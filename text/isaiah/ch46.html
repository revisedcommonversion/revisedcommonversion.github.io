    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Bel bows down and Nebo stoops.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your loads were heavy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They were a burden to the weary beast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> They stoop. They bow down together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They could not deliver the burden,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they themselves have gone into captivity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Listen to me, O house of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the remnant of the house of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which are borne by me from the birth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which are carried from the womb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And even to your old age I am he.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And even to hoary hairs I will carry you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have made and I will bear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will even carry and will deliver you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> To whom will you compare me and make me equal,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and compare me so that we may be alike?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> They lavish gold out of the bag<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and weigh silver in the balance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hire a goldsmith and he makes it a god.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They fall down and they even worship.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They bear him upon the shoulder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They carry him and set him in his place and he stands.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From his place he shall not move.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, one shall cry to him, yet he cannot answer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor save him out of his trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Remember this, and show yourselves men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bring it back to mind, O transgressors.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Remember the former things of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am God, and there is no one else.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am God, and there is no one like me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Declaring the end from the beginning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, 'My counsel shall stand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will do all my pleasure;'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Calling a ravenous bird from the east,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the man who executes my counsel from a far country.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have spoken it and I will also bring it to pass.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have purposed it and I will also perform it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Listen to me, you stout-hearted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who are far from righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> I bring my righteousness near. It shall not be far off,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my salvation shall not delay.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will place salvation in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for Israel my glory."</p>
