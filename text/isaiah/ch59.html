    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it cannot save,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither his ear heavy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it cannot hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> But your iniquities have come between<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and separated you and your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your sins have hid his face from you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he will not hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For your hands are defiled with blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your fingers with iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your lips have spoken lies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your tongue has uttered perverseness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> No one calls for justice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor any pleads for truth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They trust in vanity and speak lies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They hatch adders' eggs<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and weave the spider's web.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who eats their eggs dies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Their webs shall not become garments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall they cover themselves with their works.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their works are works of iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the act of violence is in their hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Their feet run to evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they make haste to shed innocent blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Wasting and destruction are in their paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The way of peace they do not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no judgment in their goings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have made themselves crooked paths.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Whoever goes therein shall not know peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Therefore, judgment is far from us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does justice overtake us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We wait for light, but behold obscurity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> We grope for the wall like the blind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we grope as if we had no eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We stumble at noon day as in the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We are in desolate places as dead men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> We all roar like bears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and mourn bitterly like doves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We look for judgment, but there is none,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for salvation, but it is far from us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our sins testify against us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for our transgressions are with us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as for our iniquities, we know them,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> In transgressing and lying against the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and departing away from our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />speaking oppression and revolt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And judgment is turned away backward,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and justice stands afar off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For truth has fallen in the street,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and equity cannot enter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Indeed, truth fails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he who departs from evil makes himself plunder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the LORD saw it, and it displeased him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that there was no judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And he saw that there was no man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wondered that there was no intercessor;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, his arm brought salvation to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his righteousness, it sustained him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For he put on righteousness as a breast-plate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a helmet of salvation upon his head.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To the coastlands he will repay recompense.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> So they shall fear the name of the LORD from the west,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his glory from the rising of the sun.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the enemy comes in like a flood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Spirit of the LORD will lift up a standard against him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "And the Redeemer will come to Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>21 "As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD. "My Spirit who is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your children, nor out of the mouth of your children's children," says the LORD, "from now on and forever."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/isaiah/MHC%20-%20Isaiah%2C%20Chapter%2059.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Isaiah, Chapter 59</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.5a] - "hatch adders' eggs" - This is a proverbial saying, as adders give live birth. WBS/KJV: "cockatrice eggs." (A cockatrice is a serpent imagined to proceed from a chicken egg.) The expression simply means that whatever comes from them is poison and brings death (Geneva Bible study notes).</p>
  <p>[v.5b] - "weave the spider's web" - This is another proverbial saying meaning that they are profitable to no purpose (Geneva Bible study notes).</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Quoted in Romans 3:15-16.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoted in Romans 3:17.</p>
  <p>[v.17] - Quoted in Ephesians 6:14, 17.</p>
  <p>[v.20-21] - Quoted in Romans 11:26-27.</p>
