  <p>1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink." 3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah the son of Habaziniah, his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, 4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door. 5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and cups, and I said to them, "Drink wine." 6 But they said, "We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, 'You shall drink no wine—neither you, nor your sons forever— 7 Neither shall you build house, sow seed, plant vineyard, nor have any. But all your days you shall dwell in tents so that you may live many days in the land where you are strangers.' 8 Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days—we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters— 9 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in, neither do we have vineyard, field, nor seed. 10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. 11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, 'Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.' So we dwell at Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>12 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 13 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?" says the LORD. 14 "The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed. For to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you did not listen to me. 15 I have also sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, 'Return each of you now from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. 16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me,'"' 17 Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard, and I have called to them, but they have not answered.'"</p>

  <p>18 And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he has commanded you, 19 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before me forever."'"</p>
