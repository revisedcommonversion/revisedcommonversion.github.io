  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Thus says the LORD: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this word there, 2 And say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, who sits upon the throne of David—you, your servants, and your people who enter by these gates. 3 Thus says the LORD: "Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver him who is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor. And do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. 4 For if you do this thing indeed, then there shall enter by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—he, his servants, and his people. 5 But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself," says the LORD, "that this house shall become a desolation."'" 6 For thus says the LORD to the king's house of Judah:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"You are Gilead to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the head of Lebanon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet surely I will make you a wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cities which are not inhabited.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And I will prepare destroyers against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each with his weapons,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall cut down your choice cedars<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast them into the fire.</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 "And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall each say to his neighbor, 'Why has the LORD done so to this great city?' 9 Then they shall answer, 'Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them.'"</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Do not weep for the dead,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither bemoan him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but weep bitterly for him who goes away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he shall no longer return,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor see his native country.</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place: "He shall not return there anymore, 12 But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive and shall no longer see this land.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his chambers by wrong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who uses his neighbor's service without wages<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not give him his wages,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Who says, 'I will build myself a wide house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and large chambers,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cuts out windows for himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Shall you reign because you close yourself in cedar?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Did your father not eat and drink<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do judgment and justice?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then it was well with him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He judged the cause of the poor and needy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then it was well with him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was this not to know me?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> "But your eyes and your heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are only for your covetousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for shedding innocent blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for oppression, and for violence, to do it."</p>
  </div>

    <p>18 Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"They shall not lament for him, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Ah, my brother!' or, 'Ah, sister!'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall not lament for him, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Ah, lord!' or, 'Ah, his glory!'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Go up to Lebanon, and cry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lift up your voice in Bashan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cry from the passages,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for all your lovers are destroyed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> I spoke to you in your prosperity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you said, 'I will not hear.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This has been your manner from your youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have not obeyed my voice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The wind shall eat up all your pastors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your lovers shall go into captivity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely then you shall be ashamed and confounded<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for all your wickedness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> O inhabitant of Lebanon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who makes your nest in the cedars,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />how gracious you shall be when pangs come upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the pain as of a woman in travail!</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 "As I live," says the LORD, "though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet I would pluck you from there. 25 And I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life and into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 26 And I will cast out you and your mother who bore you into another country where you were not born. And there you shall die. 27 But to the land to which they desire to return, they shall not return there.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> "Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why are they cast out—he and his offspring—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are cast into a land which they do not know?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> O earth, earth, earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />hear the word of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Write this man childless,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a man who shall not prosper in his days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for no man of his offspring shall prosper,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />sitting upon the throne of David<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and ruling anymore in Judah.'"</p>
