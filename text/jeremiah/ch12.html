  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; You are righteous, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I plead with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet let me speak with you of your judgments.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why does the way of the wicked prosper?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why are they all happy who deal very treacherously?</p>

    <p>2&emsp; You have planted them, they have even taken root.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They grow, they even bring forth fruit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are near in their mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and far from their heart.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; But you, O LORD, know me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have seen me and tried my heart toward you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; How long shall the land mourn<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the herbs of every field wither<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the wickedness of those who dwell therein?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The beasts are consumed, and also the birds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they said, "He will not see our last end."</p>

    <p>5&emsp; "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then how can you contend with horses?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if in the land of peace, in which you have trusted, they wearied you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then how will you do in the swelling of the Jordan?</p>

    <p>6&emsp; For even your brothers and the house of your father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even they have dealt treacherously with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have even called a multitude after you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not believe them, though they speak fair words to you."</p>

    <p>7&emsp; "I have forsaken my house.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have left my heritage.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have given the dearly beloved of my soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the hand of her enemies.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; My heritage is to me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a lion in the forest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It cries out against me;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I have hated it.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; My heritage is to me as a speckled bird.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The birds around are against her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Come, assemble all the beasts of the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />come to devour.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have trodden my portion under foot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have made my pleasant portion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a desolate wilderness.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;They have made it desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and being desolate it mourns to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The whole land is made desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because no man lays it to heart.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;The destroyers have come upon all high places through the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the sword of the LORD shall devour<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from one end of the land even to the other end of the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No flesh shall have peace.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall be ashamed of your revenues<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the fierce anger of the LORD."</p>
  </div>

  <p>14 Thus says the LORD against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: "Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. 15 And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I will return and have compassion on them, and will bring them back, every man to his heritage and every man to his land. 16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, 'The LORD lives,' as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they shall be built in the midst of my people. 17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation," says the LORD.</p>
