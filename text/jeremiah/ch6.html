  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; "O children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of the midst of Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blow the trumpet in Tekoa,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for evil appears out of the north,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and great destruction.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; I have compared the daughter of Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a beautiful and delicate woman.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall pitch their tents against her on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall each feed in his place.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Prepare war against her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, and let us go up at noon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Woe to us! For the day departs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the shadows of the evening are lengthened.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Arise, and let us go by night<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy her palaces."</p>

    <p>6&emsp; For thus the LORD of hosts has said:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Hew down trees<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast a siege-mound against Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This is the city to be visited.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; As a fountain casts out her waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so she casts out her wickedness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Violence and devastation is heard in her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Continually before me are grief and wounds.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Be instructed, O Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest my soul depart from you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest I make you desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a land not inhabited."</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Thus says the LORD of hosts:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Turn back your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a grape-gatherer into the baskets."</p>

    <p>10&emsp;To whom shall I speak and give warning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may hear?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, their ear is uncircumcised<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they cannot listen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have no delight in it.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Therefore, I am full of the fury of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am weary with holding in.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I will pour it out upon the children abroad<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the assembly of young men together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For even the husband with the wife shall be taken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the aged with him who is full of days.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And their houses shall be turned to others,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with their fields and wives together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;"For from their least even to their greatest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />everyone is given to covetousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And from the prophet even to the priest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />everyone deals falsely.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;They have also healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No. They were not at all ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither could they blush.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At the time that I visit them they shall be cast down,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Stand in the ways and see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and ask for the old paths,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where the good way is, and walk in it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall find rest for your souls.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Also I set watchmen over you, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Listen to the sound of the trumpet.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But they said, 'We will not listen.'</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Therefore, hear, you nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and know, O congregation, what is among them.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Hear, O earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, I will bring evil upon this people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the fruit of their thoughts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have not listened to my words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor to my law, but have rejected it.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;For what purpose does incense come to me from Sheba<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the sweet cane from a distant country?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor your sacrifices sweet to me."</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Therefore, thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The neighbor and his friend shall perish."</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, a people comes from the north country,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;They shall lay hold on bow and spear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are cruel and have no mercy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their voice roars like the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they ride upon horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />set in array as men for war<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against you, O daughter of Zion."</p>

    <p>24&emsp;We have heard its fame. Our hands become feeble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Anguish has taken hold of us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Do not go forth into the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor walk by the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the sword of the enemy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fear is on every side.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;O daughter of my people, gird yourself with sackcloth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wallow yourself in ashes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make for yourself a mourning, as for an only son,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a most bitter lamentation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;"I have set you for a tower and a fortress among my people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may know and try their way."</p>

    <p>28&emsp;They are all grievous revolters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />walking slanderously.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are brass and iron.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are all corrupters.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;The bellows is burned.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lead is consumed by the fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The founder melts in vain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;Men shall call them reprobate silver<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the LORD has rejected them.</p>
