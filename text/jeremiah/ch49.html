  <p>1 [<span class="it">Concerning the Ammonites.</span>] Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Does Israel have no sons?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Does he have no heir?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why then does their king inherit Gad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his people dwell in his cities?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Therefore, behold, the days come,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in Rabbah of the Ammonites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be a desolate heap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her daughters shall be burned with fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then Israel shall be heir to those who were his heirs,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cry, you daughters of Rabbah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Gird yourselves with sackcloth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Lament, and run to and fro by the hedges.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For their king shall go into captivity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his priests and his princes together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Why do you glory in the valleys,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who trusted in her treasures, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Who shall come to me?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Behold, I will bring a fear upon you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Lord GOD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"from all those who are around you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall each be driven out headlong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And no one shall gather up him who wanders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And afterward, I will bring back the captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the children of Ammon,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 [<span class="it">Concerning Edom.</span>] Thus says the LORD of hosts:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Is wisdom no longer in Teman?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has counsel perished from the prudent?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has their wisdom vanished?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Flee, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the time that I will visit him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> If grape-gatherers come to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />would they not leave some gleaning grapes?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If thieves by night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they will destroy until they have enough.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But I have made Esau bare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have uncovered his secret places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall not be able to hide himself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His offspring is laid waste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />along with his brothers and his neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he is no more.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Leave your fatherless children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will preserve them alive.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let your widows trust in me."</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink the cup have assuredly drank. And are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink it. 13 For I have sworn by myself," says the LORD, "that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I have heard a rumor from the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and an ambassador is sent to the heathen, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Assemble, and come against her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rise up to the battle,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For behold, I will make you small among the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and despised among men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Your terribleness has deceived you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the pride of your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who hold the height of the hill.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though you should make your nest as high as the eagle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will bring you down from there,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>17 "Also, Edom shall be a desolation. Everyone who goes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all her plagues. 18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighboring cities," says the LORD, "no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. 19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the habitation of the strong, but I will suddenly make him run away from her. And who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her? For who is like me? And who will appoint me the time? And who is that shepherd who will stand before me?"</p>

  <p>20 Therefore, hear the counsel of the LORD that he has taken against Edom, and also his purposes that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman. Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out. Surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. 21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall. At the cry its noise was heard in the Red Sea. 22 Behold, he shall come up and fly like the eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah. And at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be like the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>

  <p>23 [<span class="it">Concerning Damascus.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Hamath is confounded, and also Arpad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have heard evil tidings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are faint-hearted.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is sorrow on the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It cannot be quiet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Damascus has become feeble and turns herself to flee,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fear has seized upon her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Anguish and sorrows have taken her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like a woman in travail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> How the city of praise is not left,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the city of my joy!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Therefore, her young men shall fall in her streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> "And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad."</p>
  </div>

  <p>28 [<span class="it">Concerning Kedar and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall smite.</span>] Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Arise, go up to Kedar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay waste the men of the east.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Their tents and their flocks they shall take away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall take for themselves their curtains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all their vessels, and their camels,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall cry to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Fear is on every side.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Flee, get yourselves far off, dwell deep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O inhabitants of Hazor,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has taken counsel against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has conceived a purpose against you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Arise, go up to the wealthy nation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that dwells without care,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"which have neither gates nor bars,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which dwell alone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And their camels shall be loot<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the multitude of their cattle for plunder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will scatter into all winds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />those who are in the utmost corners,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bring their calamity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from all sides of it,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> "And Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a desolation forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No man shall abide there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor any son of man dwell in it."</p>
  </div>

  <p>34 [<span class="it">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.</span>]</p>

  <p>35 Thus says the LORD of hosts:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the chief of their might.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> And upon Elam I will bring the four winds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the four quarters of heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will scatter them toward all those winds.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there shall be no nation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and before those who seek their life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will bring evil upon them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even my fierce anger,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and I will send the sword after them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I have consumed them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> And I will set my throne in Elam<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will destroy from there the king and the princes,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> "But it shall come to pass in the latter days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I will bring back the captivity of Elam,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
