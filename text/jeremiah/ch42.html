  <p>1 Then all the captains of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest came near, 2 And said to Jeremiah the prophet, "We implore you, let our supplication be accepted before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, even for all this remnant (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes behold us), 3 So that the LORD your God may show us the way in which we may walk and the thing that we may do." 4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words. And it shall come to pass, that whatever thing the LORD answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you." 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to all things for which the LORD your God sends you to us. 6 Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send you, so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God."</p>

  <p>7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. 8 Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, 9 And said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him: 10 'If you will still abide in this land, then I will build you and not pull you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up, for I repent of the evil that I have done to you. 11 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him,' says the LORD, 'for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand. 12 And I will show mercies to you, so that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land. 13 But if you say, "We will not dwell in this land," neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, 14 Saying, "No, but we will go into the land of Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread. And there we will dwell," 15 Then therefore, hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "If you wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt and go to sojourn there, 16 Then it shall come to pass, that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt. And there you shall die. 17 Thus it shall be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there. They shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them."'</p>

  <p>18 "For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'As my anger and my fury has been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my fury shall be poured forth upon you when you enter into Egypt. And you shall be an execration, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach, and you shall see this place no more.' 19 The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, 'Do not go into Egypt.' Know certainly that I have admonished you this day. 20 For you dissembled in your hearts when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, 'Pray for us to the LORD our God, and according to all that the LORD our God says, declare it to us, and we will do it.' 21 And now I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor anything for which he has sent me to you. 22 Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go and to sojourn."</p>
