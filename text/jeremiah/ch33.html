  <p>1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time while he was yet confined in the court of the prison, saying, 2 "Thus says the LORD, the maker of this, the LORD who formed it to establish it, Yahweh is his name: 3 'Call to me, and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things which you do not know.' 4 For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the siege-mounds and by the sword: 5 'They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure. I will cure them and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth. 7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return and will build them, as at the first. 8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned and by which they have transgressed against me. 9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.'</p>

  <p>10 "Thus says the LORD: 'Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, without inhabitant, and without beast, 11 The voice of joy, the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, the voice of the bride, and the voice of those who shall say, "Praise the LORD of hosts, for the LORD is good. For his mercy endures forever," and of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captivity of the land to return, as at the first,' says the LORD.</p>

  <p>12 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. 13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, in the cities of the south, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall pass again under the hands of him who counts them,' says the LORD.</p>

  <p>14 'Behold, the days come,' says the LORD, 'that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 15 In those days and at that time I will cause the branch of righteousness to grow up to David, and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 16 In those days Judah shall be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety. And this is the name by which she shall be called: YAHWEH Our Righteousness.' 17 For thus says the LORD: 'David shall never lack a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel, 18 Neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, to kindle food-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.'"</p>

  <p>19 And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 20 "Thus says the LORD: 'If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night so that there should not be day and night in their season, 21 Then may my covenant also be broken with David my servant so that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne, and also with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.'"</p>

  <p>23 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 24 "Do you not consider what this people has spoken, saying, 'The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off'? Thus they have despised my people so that they should no longer be a nation before them. 25 Thus says the LORD: 'If my covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, 26 Then I will cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them.'"</p>
