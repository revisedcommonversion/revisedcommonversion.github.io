  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then the LORD said to me, "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people. Cast them out of my sight and let them go forth.</p>

  <p>2 And it shall come to pass, that they shall say to you, 'Where shall we go forth?' Then you shall tell them, 'Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Those who are for death, to death.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who are for the sword, to the sword.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who are for the famine, to the famine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who are for the captivity, to the captivity."'</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 "And I will appoint over them four kinds," says the LORD. "The sword to slay, the dogs to tear, the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy. 4 And I will cause them to be a horror among all kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> "For who shall have pity upon you, O Jerusalem?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who shall bemoan you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who shall go aside<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to ask concerning your welfare?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You have forsaken me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"you have gone backward;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I will stretch out my hand against you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am weary with repenting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And I will fan them with a fan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the gates of the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will bereave them of children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will destroy my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />since they do not return from their ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Their widows are multiplied to me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />above the sand of the seas.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have brought upon them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against the mother of the young men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a destroyer at noon-day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and terrors upon the city.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> She who has borne seven languishes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She has resigned her breath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her sun has gone down while it was yet day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She has been ashamed and confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their remnant I will deliver to the sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before their enemies,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor have men lent to me on usury, yet every one of them curses me. 11 The LORD said, "Truly it shall be well with your remnant. Truly I will cause the enemy to treat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. 12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 13 Your substance and your treasures I will give as plunder without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders. 14 And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you do not know, for a fire is kindled in my anger which shall burn upon you."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> O LORD, you know.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Remember me, visit me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and avenge me of my persecutors.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not take me away in your patience.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Your words were found, and I ate them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your word was to me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the joy and rejoicing of my heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am called by your name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD God of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sat alone because of your hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have filled me with indignation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which refuses to be healed?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you be altogether to me as a liar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as waters that fail?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Therefore, thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"If you return, then I will bring you back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall stand before me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if you separate the precious from the vile,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you shall be as my mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall return to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall not return to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> And I will make you to this people a fortified brazen wall.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall fight against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they shall not prevail against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am with you to save you and to deliver you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> "And I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and redeem you from the hand of the terrible."</p>
