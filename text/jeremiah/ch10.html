  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.</p>

  <p>2 Thus says the LORD: "Do not learn the way of the heathen, and do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven, for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>

  <p>3 For the customs of the people are vain. For one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.</p>

  <p>4 They deck it with silver and with gold. They fasten it with nails and with hammers so that it may not move.</p>

  <p>5 They are upright as the palm tree, but do not speak. They must be borne because they cannot go. Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it also in them to do good."</p>

  <p>6 There is no one like you, O LORD. You are great, and your name is great in might.</p>

  <p>7 Who would not fear you, O King of nations? For to you it appertains, because among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you.</p>

  <p>8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish. The stock is a doctrine of vanities.</p>

  <p>9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder. Their clothing is blue and purple. They are all the work of skillful men.</p>

  <p>10 But the LORD is the true God. He is the living God and an everlasting king. At his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>

  <p>11 Thus you shall say to them: "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens."</p>

  <p>12 He has made the earth by his power, has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>

  <p>13 When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>

  <p>14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge. Every founder is confounded by the engraved image, for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them.</p>

  <p>15 They are vanity and the work of errors. In the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>

  <p>16 The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things, and Israel is the rod of his inheritance. The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>

  <p>17 Gather up your wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</p>

  <p>18 For thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time and will distress them so that they are found out."</p>

  <p>19 Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is grievous, but I said, "Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it."</p>

  <p>20 My tabernacle is laid waste and all my cords are broken. My children have gone from me and they are no more. There is no one to stretch forth my tent anymore and to set up my curtains.</p>

  <p>21 For the pastors have become brutish and have not sought the LORD; therefore, they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>

  <p>22 Behold, the voice of tidings has come, and a great commotion from the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate and a den of jackals.</p>

  <p>23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself. It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</p>

  <p>24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment, not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</p>

  <p>25 Pour out your fury upon the heathen who do not know you and upon the families who do not call on your name, for they have eaten up Jacob. They have devoured him and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</p>
