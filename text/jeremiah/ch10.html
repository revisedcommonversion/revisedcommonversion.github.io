  <p>1 Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.</p>

  <p>2 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Do not learn the way of the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For the customs of the people are vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For one cuts a tree out of the forest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They deck it with silver and with gold.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They fasten it with nails and with hammers so that it may not move.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They are upright as the palm tree, but do not speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They must be borne because they cannot go.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is it also in them to do good."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> There is no one like you, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are great, and your name is great in might.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Who would not fear you, O King of nations?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For to you it appertains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there is no one like you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But they are altogether brutish and foolish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The stock is a doctrine of vanities.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gold from Uphaz,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their clothing is blue and purple.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are all the work of skillful men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But the LORD is the true God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is the living God and an everlasting king.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At his wrath the earth shall tremble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 Thus you shall say to them: "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> He has made the earth by his power,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has established the world by his wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes lightnings with rain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Every man is brutish in his knowledge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every founder is confounded by the engraved image,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> They are vanity and the work of errors.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The portion of Jacob is not like them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he is the former of all things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel is the rod of his inheritance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Gather up your wares out of the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O inhabitant of the fortress.</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 For thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will distress them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they are found out."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Woe is me for my hurt!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My wound is grievous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I said, "Truly this is a grief,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I must bear it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> My tabernacle is laid waste<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all my cords are broken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My children have gone from me and they are no more.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no one to stretch forth my tent anymore<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to set up my curtains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> For the pastors have become brutish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not sought the LORD;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, they shall not prosper,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Behold, the voice of tidings has come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a great commotion from the north country,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make the cities of Judah desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a den of jackals.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Pour out your fury upon the heathen who do not know you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the families who do not call on your name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have eaten up Jacob.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have devoured him and consumed him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have made his habitation desolate.</p>
