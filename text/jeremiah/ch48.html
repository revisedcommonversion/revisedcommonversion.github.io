  <p>1 [<span class="it">Against Moab.</span>] Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Woe to Nebo! For it is laid waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Kiriathaim is confounded and taken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Misgab is confounded and dismayed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> There shall be no more praise of Moab.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In Heshbon they have devised evil against it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Also you shall be cut down, O Madmen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sword shall pursue you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Devastation and great destruction.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Moab is destroyed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For in the ascent of Luhith<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />continual weeping shall go up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For in the descent of Horonaim<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Flee, save your lives,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be like the heath in the wilderness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For because you have trusted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in your works and in your treasures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you also shall be taken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And Chemosh shall go forth into captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with his priests and his princes together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And the destroyer shall come upon every city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no city shall escape.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The valley shall also perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the plain shall be destroyed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the LORD has spoken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Give wings to Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it may flee and get away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for its cities shall be desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without any to dwell in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD deceitfully,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Moab has been at ease from his youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he has settled on his dregs<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither has he gone into captivity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, his taste remained in him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his scent is not changed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> "Therefore, behold, the days come,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that I will send to him wanderers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who shall cause him to wander,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall empty his vessels<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and break their bottles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the house of Israel was ashamed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of Beth-el their confidence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "How do you say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'We are mighty and strong men for the war'?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Moab is laid waste and gone up out of her cities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the King,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose name is the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> "The calamity of Moab is near to come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his affliction hastens fast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> All you who are around him bemoan him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all you who know his name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />say, 'How the strong staff is broken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the beautiful rod!'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> You daughter who inhabits Dibon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />come down from your glory and sit in thirst,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the destroyer of Moab shall come upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall destroy your strongholds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ask him who flees and her who escapes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say, 'What has been done?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Moab is confounded, for it is broken down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Howl and cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Tell it in Arnon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that Moab is laid waste.</p>
  </div>

  <p>21 "And judgment has come upon the plain country: upon Holon, upon Jahazah, upon Mephaath, 22 Upon Dibon, upon Nebo, upon Beth-diblathaim, 23 Upon Kiriathaim, upon Beth-gamul, upon Beth-meon, 24 Upon Kerioth, upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken," says the LORD. 26 "Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against the LORD. Moab shall also wallow in his vomit and shall also be in derision. 27 For was Israel not a derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For since you have spoken of him, you have leaped for joy.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> "O you who dwell in Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />leave the cities, dwell in the rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be like the dove that makes her nest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the sides of the hole's mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> We have heard the pride of Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(he is exceedingly proud),<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his loftiness, his arrogance, his pride,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the haughtiness of his heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> I know his wrath," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that it is nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His boastings have wrought nothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Therefore, I will howl for Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will cry out for all Moab.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> O vine of Sibmah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your plants have gone over the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They reach even to the sea of Jazer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The destroyer has fallen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> And joy and gladness is taken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have caused wine to fail from the wine-presses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No one shall tread with shouting.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their shouting shall be no shouting.</p>
  </div>

  <p>34 "From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, and even to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, as a heifer of three years old. For the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. 35 Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab," says the LORD, "him who offers in the high places and him who burns incense to his gods.</p>

  <p>36 "Therefore, my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres because the riches that he has gotten have perished. 37 For every head shall be bald and every beard clipped. Upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth. 38 There shall be lamentation generally upon all the house-tops of Moab and in its streets, for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure," says the LORD. 39 "They shall howl, saying, 'How it is broken down! How Moab has turned the back with shame!' So Moab shall be a derision and a dismaying to all who are around him."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> For thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, he shall fly as an eagle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall spread his wings over Moab.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> Kerioth is taken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the strongholds are surprised,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he has magnified himself against the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> Fear, the pit, and the snare<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> "He who flees from the fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall fall into the pit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he who gets out of the pit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be taken in the snare.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I will bring upon it, even upon Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the year of their visitation," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> "Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the force.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But a fire shall come out of Heshbon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a flame from the midst of Sihon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall devour the corner of Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> Woe to you, O Moab!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The people of Chemosh perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your sons are taken as captives<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your daughters as captives.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">47</span> Yet I will bring back the captivity of Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the latter days," says the LORD.</p>
