  <p>1 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, I will raise up a destroying wind against Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and against those who dwell in the midst of those who rise against me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And will send fanners to Babylon who shall fan her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall empty her land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For in the day of trouble they shall be against her on all sides.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Against him who bends, let the archer bend his bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and against him who lifts himself up in his coat of mail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And do not spare her young men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Utterly destroy all her host.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are thrust through in her streets."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For Israel has not been forsaken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor Judah by his God, by the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Flee from the midst of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and deliver every man his soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not be cut off in her iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for this is the time of the LORD'S vengeance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will render to her a recompense.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD'S hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who made all the earth drunken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The nations have drank of her wine;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, the nations are mad.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Howl for her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Take balm for her pain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It may be that she may be healed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Forsake her, and let us each go into his own country,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for her judgment reaches to heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and is lifted even to the skies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The LORD has brought forth our righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Come, and let us declare in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of the LORD our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Make the arrows bright.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Gather the shields.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his purpose is against Babylon to destroy it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because it is the vengeance of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the vengeance of his temple.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make the watch strong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Set up the watchmen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Prepare the ambushes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the LORD has both devised and done<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> O you who dwell upon many waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />abundant in treasures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your end has come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the measure of your covetousness.</p>
  </div>

  <p>14 The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Surely I will fill you with men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with licking-locusts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall raise a shout against you."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He has made the earth by his power,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he has established the world by his wisdom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has stretched out the heaven by his understanding.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> When he utters his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes lightnings with rain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Every man is brutish by his knowledge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every founder is confounded by the engraved image,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his molten image is falsehood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no breath in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> They are vanity, the work of errors.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The portion of Jacob is not like them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he is the former of all things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel is the rod of his inheritance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "You are my battle-ax and weapons of war.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For with you I will break in pieces the nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with you I will destroy kingdoms,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> With you I will break in pieces the horse and his rider,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with you I will break in pieces the chariot and its rider,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> With you I will break in pieces man and woman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with you I will break in pieces old and young,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with you I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> With you I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with you I will break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with you I will break in pieces captains and rulers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> "Behold, I am against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O destroying mountain," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"which destroys all the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will stretch out my hand upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />roll you down from the rocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make you a burnt mountain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And they shall not take of you a stone for a corner,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor a stone for foundations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall be desolate forever," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Set up a standard in the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blow the trumpet among the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Prepare the nations against her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Appoint a captain against her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cause the horses to come up as the rough licking-locusts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of Media,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />her captains, and all her rulers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the land of his dominion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> And the land shall tremble and sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have remained in their holds.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their might has failed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They became as women.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have burned her dwelling-places.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her bars are broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> One post shall run to meet another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and one messenger to meet another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And that the passages are stopped,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the reeds they have burned with fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the men of war are terrified.</p>
  </div>

  <p>33 For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it is time to thresh her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has crushed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has made me an empty vessel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has swallowed me up like a dragon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has filled his belly with my delicacies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has cast me out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the inhabitant of Zion shall say.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Jerusalem shall say.</p>
  </div>

  <p>36 Therefore, thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Behold, I will plead your cause<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take vengeance for you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will dry up her sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make her springs dry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> And Babylon shall become heaps,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a dwelling-place for jackals,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />an astonishment, and a hissing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without an inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> They shall roar together like lions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall yell as lions' whelps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> In their heat I will make their feasts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will make them drunken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may rejoice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> "I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like rams with male goats.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> How Sheshach is taken!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And how the praise of the whole earth is surprised!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How Babylon has become an astonishment among the nations!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> The sea has come up upon Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She is covered with the multitude of its waves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> Her cities are a desolation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br /> a dry land, and a wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a land in which no man dwells,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does any son of man pass by it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> And I will punish Bel in Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the nations shall not flow together anymore to him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even the wall of Babylon shall fall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> My people, depart from the midst of her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and each of you deliver his soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> And lest your heart should faint and you should fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the rumor that shall be heard in the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a rumor shall both come one year,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and after that in another year a rumor shall come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">47</span> Therefore, behold, the days come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I will do judgment upon the engraved images of Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And her whole land shall be confounded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">48</span> Then the heaven and the earth and all that is in them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall sing for Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the destroyers shall come to her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the north," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">49</span> As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">50</span> You who have escaped the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />go away, do not stand still.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Remember the LORD afar off<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">51</span> We are confounded because we have heard reproach.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shame has covered our faces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for strangers have come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the sanctuaries of the LORD'S house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">52</span> "Therefore, behold, the days come," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that I will do judgment upon her engraved images.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And through all her land the wounded shall groan.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">53</span> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and though she should fortify the height of her strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet from me destroyers shall come to her," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">54</span> A sound of a cry comes from Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">55</span> Because the LORD has laid waste Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroyed out of her the great voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When her waves roar like great waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a noise of their voice is uttered,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">56</span> Because the destroyer has come upon her, even upon Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her mighty men are taken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />every one of their bows is broken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">57</span> "And I will make drunk her princes, her wise men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />her captains, her rulers, and her mighty men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</p>
  </div>

  <p>58 Thus says the LORD of hosts:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her high gates shall be burned with fire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The people shall labor in vain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the nations for the fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be weary."</p>
  </div>

  <p>59 This is the word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you come to Babylon and see, and read all these words, 62 You shall say, 'O LORD, you have spoken against this place to cut it off so that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate forever.' 63 And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, 64 And you shall say, 'Thus Babylon shall sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her, and they shall be weary.'"</p>

  <p>[<span class="it">Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</span>]</p>
