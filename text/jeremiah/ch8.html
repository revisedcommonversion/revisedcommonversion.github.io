  <p>1 "At that time," says the LORD, "they shall bring the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of the princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves, 2 And they shall spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, whom they have served, after whom they have walked, whom they have sought, and whom they have worshiped. They shall not be gathered, nor be buried. They shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. 3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the remnant of those who remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them," says the LORD of hosts.</p>

  <p>4 "Moreover, you shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>"Shall they fall and not arise?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall he turn away and not return?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Why then has this people of Jerusalem slid back<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by a perpetual backsliding?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They hold fast deceit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they refuse to return.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I listened and heard,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they did not speak aright.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No man repented of his wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, 'What have I done?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone turned to his course,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the horse rushes to the battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Even the stork in the heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />knows her appointed times.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />observe the time of their coming.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But my people do not know<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the judgment of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> How do you say, 'We are wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the law of the LORD is with us'?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, certainly in vain he has made it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The pen of the scribes is in vain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The wise men are ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are dismayed and taken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what wisdom is in them?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Therefore, I will give their wives to others<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their fields to those who inherit them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for everyone from the least even to the greatest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is given to covetousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the prophet even to the priest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each deals falsely.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No. They were not at all ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither could they blush.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the time of their visitation they shall be cast down,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> "I will surely consume them," says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"There shall be no grapes on the vine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor figs on the fig-tree,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the leaf shall fade.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the things that I have given to them shall pass away from them."'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Why do we sit still?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be silent there.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the LORD our God has put us to silence<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and given us water of gall to drink<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because we have sinned against the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> We looked for peace, but no good came,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for a time of health, and behold, trouble!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The whole land trembled<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have come and have devoured the land and all that is in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also the city and those who dwell therein.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> "For behold, I will send serpents among you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />adders which will not be charmed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall bite you," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> When I would comfort myself against sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my heart is faint in me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of those who dwell in a distant country:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Is the LORD not in Zion?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is her king not in her?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with strange vanities?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "The harvest has past, the summer has ended,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we are not saved."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am black. Astonishment has taken hold upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Is there no balm in Gilead?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is there no physician there?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why then is the health<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the daughter of my people not recovered?</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.6] - "No man repented of his wickedness" - This is the sign of a false conversion. Notice from verse 5 that the people of Jerusalem have backslid. A true conversion must have repentance, as Paul shows in 2nd Corinthians 7:10, which says, "godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of..." See also, Isaiah 59:20; Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3, 5; Acts 3:19, 17:30-31; Revelation 3:19.</p>
