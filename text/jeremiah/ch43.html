  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words, 2 Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, "You speak falsely. The LORD our God has not sent you to say, 'Do not go into Egypt to sojourn there.' 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah entices you against us to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans so that they may put us to death and carry us away as captives into Babylon." 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD to dwell in the land of Judah. 5 But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all nations where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah— 6 Even men, women, children, the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 7 So they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. Thus they came even to Tahpanhes.</p>

  <p>8 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 9 "Take great stones in your hand and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah, 10 And say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid, and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. 11 And when he comes, he shall smite the land of Egypt and deliver those who are for death to death, and those who are for captivity to captivity, and those who are for the sword to the sword. 12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captives. And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, and he shall go forth from there in peace. 13 He shall also break the images of Beth-shemesh, which is in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians he shall burn with fire."'"</p>
