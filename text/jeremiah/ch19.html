  <p>1 Thus says the LORD: "Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take some of the ancients of the people and some of the ancients of the priests, 2 And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell you, 3 And say, 'Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle, 4 Because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents. 5 They have also built the high places of Baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt-offerings to Baal, which I did not command nor speak it, neither did it come into my mind. 6 Therefore, behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that this place shall no longer be called Tophet, nor The Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter. 7 And I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. And I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And their carcasses I will give to be food for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. 8 And I will make this city desolate and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. 9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them."'</p>

  <p>10 "Then you shall break the bottle in the sight of the men who go with you, 11 And shall say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter's vessel that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no place to bury. 12 Thus I will do to this place," says the LORD, "and to its inhabitants, and even make this city like Tophet. 13 And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be defiled like the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods."'"</p>

  <p>14 Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house and said to all the people, 15 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear my words.'"</p>
