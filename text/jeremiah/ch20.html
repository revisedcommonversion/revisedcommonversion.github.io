  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. 2 Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. 3 And it came to pass on the next day, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, "The LORD has not called your name Pashur, but Magor-missabib. 4 For thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall behold it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon and shall slay them with the sword. 5 Moreover, I will deliver all the strength of this city, all its labors, all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, who shall pillage them, take them, and carry them to Babylon. 6 And you, Pashur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity. And you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die and shall be buried—you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.'"</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>7&emsp; O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am in derision daily.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone mocks me.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; For as often as I speak, I cry out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I proclaim, "Violence and destruction,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the word of the LORD is made to me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />continual reproach and derision.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Then I said, "I will not make mention of him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor speak anymore in his name."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But his word was in my heart as a burning fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shut up in my bones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was weary with forbearing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I could not stay.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For I heard the defaming of many,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />fear on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Report," they say, "and we will report it."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All my familiar friends watched for my fall, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Perhaps he will be enticed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we shall prevail against him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take our revenge on him."</p>

    <p>11&emsp;But the LORD is with me as an awesome mighty one;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, my persecutors shall stumble<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall not prevail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be greatly ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall not prosper.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their everlasting disgrace shall never be forgotten.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;But, O LORD of hosts, who tries the righteous<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sees the mind and the heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />let me see your vengeance on them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I have opened my cause to you.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Sing to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />praise the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he has delivered the soul of the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the hand of evil-doers.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Cursed is the day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which I was born.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Cursed is the man who brought tidings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to my father, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"A male child is born to you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />making him very glad.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;And let that man be as the cities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which the LORD overthrew, and did not repent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let him hear the cry in the morning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the shouting at noon,</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Because he did not slay me at my birth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that my mother might have been my grave<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she always be great with child.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Why was I brought into the world<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to see labor and sorrow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that my days should be consumed with shame?</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.17] - "and she always be great with child" - This rendering follows a euphemism typical with Noah Webster, where he avoided the use of the word, "womb." (The same was done earlier in this verse.) A literal translation would be, "and her womb a pregnancy age-during."</p>
