  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and now see, and know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and seek in its broad places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if you can find a man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if there is anyone who executes judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who seeks the truth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then I will pardon it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And though they say, 'The LORD lives,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />surely they swear falsely."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> O LORD, are your eyes not upon the truth?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have stricken them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they have not grieved.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have consumed them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they have refused to receive correction.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have made their faces harder than a rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have refused to return.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I said, "Surely these are poor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are foolish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they do not know the way of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the judgment of their God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I will go to the great men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and speak to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have known the way of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the judgment of their God."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But these have altogether broken the yoke<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and torn off the bonds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, a lion from the forest shall slay them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a leopard shall watch over their cities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone who goes out from there<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be torn in pieces<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because their transgressions are many<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their backslidings have increased.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> "How shall I pardon you for this?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your children have forsaken me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sworn by those who are not gods.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I had fed them to the full,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they committed adultery<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and assembled themselves by troops<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the harlots' houses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They were as fed horses in the morning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Shall I not visit for these things?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"And shall my soul not be avenged<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on such a nation as this?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Go up upon her walls and destroy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but do not make a full end.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Take away her branches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are not the LORD'S.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have dealt very treacherously against me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> They have belied the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and said, "It is not he.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Evil shall not come upon us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall we see sword nor famine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And the prophets shall become wind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the word is not in them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus it shall be done to them."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore, thus says the LORD God of hosts:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Because you speak this word,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behold, I will make my words in your mouth fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, I will bring a nation upon you from far,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O house of Israel,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"It is a mighty nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it is an ancient nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a nation whose language you do not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither understand what they say.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Their quiver is as an open sepulcher.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are all mighty men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And they shall eat up your harvest and your bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which your sons and your daughters should eat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall eat up your flocks and your herds.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall eat up your vines and your fig-trees.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall impoverish with the sword your fortified cities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which you have trusted.</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 "Nevertheless, in those days," says the LORD, "I will not make a full end with you. 19 And it shall come to pass, when you shall say, 'Why does the LORD our God do all these things to us?' Then you shall answer them, 'As you have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "Declare this in the house of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> 'Now hear this, O foolish people and without understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have eyes and do not see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have ears and do not hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Do you not fear me?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Will you not tremble at my presence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by a perpetual decree so that it cannot pass it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And though its waves toss themselves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they cannot prevail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even though they roar,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they cannot pass over it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> But this people have a revolting and a rebellious heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have revolted and gone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They do not say in their heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Let us now fear the LORD our God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He reserves to us the appointed weeks of harvest."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Your iniquities have turned away these things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your sins have withheld good things from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> For among my people are found wicked men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They lie in wait, as he who sets snares.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They set a trap. They catch men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> As a cage is full of birds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so are their houses full of deceit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, they have become great and have grown rich.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> They have become fat. They shine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They even surpass the deeds of the wicked.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not judge the cause,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the cause of the fatherless,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they prosper.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the right of the needy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they do not judge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Shall I not visit for these things?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Shall my soul not be avenged<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on such a nation as this?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> A wonderful and horrible thing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is committed in the land:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The prophets prophesy falsely,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the priests bear rule by their means,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my people love to have it so.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what will you do in the end thereof?"</p>
