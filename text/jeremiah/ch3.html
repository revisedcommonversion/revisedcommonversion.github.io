  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> They say, "If a man puts away his wife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she goes from him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and becomes another man's,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall he return to her again?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall that land not be greatly polluted?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you have played the harlot with many lovers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet return again to me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Lift up your eyes to the high places and see<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where you have not been lain with.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the roads you have sat for them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the Arabian in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have polluted the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with your acts of lewdness and with your wickedness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Therefore, the showers have been withheld<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there has been no latter rain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet you had a harlot's forehead<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you refused to be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Will you not from this time cry to me, 'My father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you are the guide of my youth'?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> 'Will he retain his anger forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will he keep it to the end?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, you have spoken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and done evil things as you could."</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 The LORD also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, "Have you seen what backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot. 7 And I said after she had done all these things, 'Turn to me.' But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 8 And I saw that for all the causes by which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also. 9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her lewdness, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly," says the LORD.</p>

  <p>11 And the LORD said to me, "The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</p>

  <p>12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'Return, you backsliding Israel,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'And I will not cause my anger to fall upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am merciful,' says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'and I will not keep anger forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Only acknowledge your iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have transgressed against the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />scattered your ways to the strangers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />under every green tree,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not obeyed my voice,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> 'Turn, O backsliding children,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'For I am married to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will take you one from a city and two from a family,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bring you to Zion.'</p>
  </div>

  <p>15 "And I will give you pastors according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 16 And it shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days," says the LORD, "they shall no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD,' neither shall it come to mind, neither shall they remember it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall that be done anymore. 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem, The Throne of the LORD, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem. They shall not walk anymore after the imagination of their evil heart. 18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.</p>

  <p>19 "But I said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'How shall I put you among the children<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give you a pleasant land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I said, 'You shall call me, My Father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall not turn away from me.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> A voice was heard upon the high places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />weeping and supplications of the children of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have perverted their way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have forgotten the LORD their God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "Return, you backsliding children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will heal your backslidings."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, we come to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are the LORD our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the multitude of mountains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Truly the salvation of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is in the LORD our God.</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 "For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 25 We lie down in our shame, and our disgrace covers us, for we have sinned against the LORD our God—we and our fathers—from our youth even to this day and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."</p>
