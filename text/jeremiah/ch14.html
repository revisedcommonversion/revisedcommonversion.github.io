  <p>1 [<span class="it">The word from the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>2&emsp; "Judah mourns, and her gates languish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are black to the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They came to the pits and found no water.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They returned with their vessels empty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Because the ground is cracked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for there was no rain on the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the plowmen were ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they covered their heads.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Even the doe also brought forth in the field and forsook it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because there was no grass.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; And the wild donkeys stood in the high places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they snuffed up the wind like jackals.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their eyes failed because there was no grass.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do it for your name's sake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for our backslidings are many.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have sinned against you.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; O the hope of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his Savior in time of trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />why should you be as a stranger in the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a way-faring man who turns aside to stay for a night?</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Why should you be as a man astonished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a mighty man who cannot save?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet you, O LORD, are in the midst of us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we are called by your name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not leave us."</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Thus says the LORD to this people:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Thus they have loved to wander,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have not restrained their feet;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, the LORD does not accept them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will now remember their iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and visit their sins."</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 Then the LORD said to me, "Do not pray for this people for their good. 12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry. And when they offer a burnt-offering and an oblation, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence."</p>

  <p>13 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! Behold, the prophets say to them, 'You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.'" 14 Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, nor spoken to them. They prophesy to you false visions, divinations, predictions, and deceits of their heart. 15 Therefore, thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I did not send them, yet they say, 'Sword and famine shall not be in this land': 'By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed. 16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, and they shall have no one to bury them—them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters—for I will pour their wickedness upon them.'</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>17&emsp;"Therefore, you shall say this word to them:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let them cease,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a very grievous blow.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;If I go forth into the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then behold the slain with the sword!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if I enter into the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then behold those who are sick with famine!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even both the prophet and the priest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have gone into a land that they do not know.'"</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Have you utterly rejected Judah?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has your soul loathed Zion?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why have you smitten us, and there is no healing for us?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We looked for peace, and there is no good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</p>

    <p>20&emsp;We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the iniquity of our fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for we have sinned against you.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Do not abhor us for your name's sake.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not disgrace the throne of your glory.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Remember, do not break your covenant with us.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles who can cause rain?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or can the heavens give showers?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Are you not he, O LORD our God?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, we will wait upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have made all these things.</p>
