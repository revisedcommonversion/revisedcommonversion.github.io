  <p>1 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2 "Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, 'Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"I remember you, the kindness of your youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the love of your espousals,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you went after me in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in a land that was not sown.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Israel was holiness to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the first-fruits of his increase.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All who devour him shall offend.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Evil shall come upon them,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.'"</p>
  </div>

  <p>4 Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob and all the families of the house of Israel. 5 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"What iniquity have your fathers found in me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that they have gone far from me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have walked after vanity and have become vain?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> They did not say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Where is the LORD who brought us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of the land of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who led us through the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through a land of deserts and of pits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through a land that no man passed through<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and where no man dwelt?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And I brought you into a plentiful country<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to eat its fruit and its goodness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when you entered, you defiled my land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made my heritage an abomination.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The priests did not say, 'Where is the LORD?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who handle the law did not know me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The pastors also transgressed against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prophets prophesied by Baal<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and walked after things that do not profit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I will yet plead with you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and with your children's children I will plead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For pass over to the coastlands of Chittim and see.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And send to Kedar and consider diligently<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and see if there is such a thing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Has a nation changed their gods<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which are yet no gods?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But my people have changed their glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for that which does not profit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Be astonished, O heavens, at this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be horribly afraid, be very desolate,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> "For my people have committed two evils:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have forsaken me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the fountain of living waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hewed out for themselves cisterns,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />broken cisterns that can hold no water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Is Israel a servant?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is he a home-born slave?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why is he laid waste?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The young lions roared upon him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and yelled and made his land waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His cities are burned<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have broken the crown of your head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Have you not procured this to yourself<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in that you have forsaken the LORD your God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he led you by the way?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And now what have you to do in the way of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to drink the waters of Sihor?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or what have you to do in the way of Assyria,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to drink the waters of the river?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Your own wickedness shall correct you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your backslidings shall reprove you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Know therefore, and see that it is an evil and bitter thing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have forsaken the LORD your God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that my fear is not in you,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "For of old time I have broken your yoke<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and torn off your bonds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you said, 'I will not transgress,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when upon every high hill<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and under every green tree<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you wander, playing the harlot.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Yet I had planted you a noble vine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />wholly a right seed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How then are you turned into the degenerate plant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of a strange vine to me?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For though you shall wash yourself with lye<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and use much soap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet your iniquity is marked before me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Lord GOD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> "How can you say, 'I am not polluted.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have not gone after Baalim'?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />See your way in the valley.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Know what you have done.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> A wild donkey used to the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in her occasion, who can turn her away?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All those who seek her will not weary themselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In her month they shall find her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Withhold your foot from being unshod<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your throat from thirst.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you said, 'There is no hope.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No, for I have loved strangers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and after them I will go.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> As the thief is ashamed when he is found,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is the house of Israel ashamed—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they, their kings, their princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their priests, and their prophets—</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Saying to a stock, 'You are my father,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to a stone, 'You have brought me forth.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they have turned their back to me and not their face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the time of their trouble they will say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Arise, and save us.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> But where are your gods<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you have made for yourself?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them arise if they can save you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the time of your trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For according to the number of your cities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are your gods, O Judah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Why will you plead with me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You all have transgressed against me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> "In vain I have smitten your children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have received no correction.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your own sword has devoured your prophets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like a destroying lion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> O generation, see the word of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have I been a wilderness to Israel?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A land of darkness?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why do my people say, 'We are lords.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will no longer come to you'?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Can a virgin forget her ornaments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or a bride her attire?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet my people have forgotten me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />days without number.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Why do you trim your way to seek love?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, you have also taught the wicked ones your ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Also in your skirts is found the blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the souls of the poor innocents.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have not found it by secret search,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but upon all these.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> Yet you say, 'Because I am innocent,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />surely his anger will turn from me.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, I will plead with you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you say, 'I have not sinned.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> Why do you go around so much<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to change your way?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall also be ashamed of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as you were ashamed of Assyria.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> You shall even go forth from him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your hands upon your head,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has rejected your confidences,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall not prosper in them."</p>
