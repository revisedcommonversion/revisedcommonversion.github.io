  <p>1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, 'Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a book. 3 For behold, the days come,' says the LORD, 'that I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,' says the LORD, 'and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.'"</p>

  <p>4 And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:</p>

  <p>5 "For thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'We have heard a voice of trembling,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of fear, and not of peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why do I see every man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all faces are turned into paleness?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Alas! For that day is great<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that none is like it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is even the time of Jacob's trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 'For it shall come to pass in that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break his yoke from off your neck and will tear off your bonds, and strangers shall no longer bring him into subjection, 9 But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> 'Therefore, do not fear, O my servant Jacob,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'neither be dismayed, O Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for behold, I will save you from afar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your offspring from the land of their captivity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Jacob shall return and be in rest and quiet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall make him afraid.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For I am with you,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'to save you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though I make a full end of all nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where I have scattered you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet I will not make a full end of you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But I will correct you in measure<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not leave you altogether unpunished.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Your bruise is incurable<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your wound is grievous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> There is no one to plead your cause,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may be bound up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have no healing medicines.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> All your lovers have forgotten you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not seek you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the chastisements of a cruel one,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the multitude of your iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because your sins were increased.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Why do you cry for your affliction?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your sorrow is incurable<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the multitude of your iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because your sins were increased,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have done these things to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Therefore, all those who devour you shall be devoured.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all your adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who plunder you shall be plunder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all who prey upon you I will give for plunder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For I will restore health to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and heal you of your wounds,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'because they called you Outcast, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"This is Zion, whom no man seeks after."'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob's tents<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have mercy on his dwelling places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the city shall be built upon her own heap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the palace shall remain after its manner.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the voice of those who make merry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Their children shall also be as in former time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their congregation shall be established before me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will punish all who oppress them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And their nobles shall be from themselves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will cause him to draw near,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall approach me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For who is this who engaged his heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to approach me?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> 'And you shall be my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will be your God.'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a continuing whirlwind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until he has done it and until he has performed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the intents of his heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the latter days you shall consider it.</p>
