  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 A word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 2 "Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, 'Write for yourself all the words that I have spoken to you in a book. 3 For behold, the days come,' says the LORD, 'that I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,' says the LORD, 'and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.'"</p>

  <p>4 And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:</p>

  <p>5 "For thus says the LORD: 'We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</p>

  <p>6 Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child. Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</p>

  <p>7 Alas! For that day is great so that none is like it. It is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</p>

  <p>8 'For it shall come to pass in that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'that I will break his yoke from off your neck and will tear off your bonds, and strangers shall no longer bring him into subjection, 9 But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</p>

  <p>10 'Therefore, do not fear, O my servant Jacob,' says the LORD, 'neither be dismayed, O Israel, for behold, I will save you from afar and your seed from the land of their captivity, and Jacob shall return and be in rest and quiet, and no one shall make him afraid.</p>

  <p>11 For I am with you,' says the LORD, 'to save you. Though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a full end of you. But I will correct you in measure and will not leave you altogether unpunished.'</p>

  <p>12 For thus says the LORD: 'Your bruise is incurable and your wound is grievous.</p>

  <p>13 There is no one to plead your cause, so that you may be bound up. You have no healing medicines.</p>

  <p>14 All your lovers have forgotten you. They do not seek you, for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisements of a cruel one, for the multitude of your iniquity because your sins were increased.</p>

  <p>15 Why do you cry for your affliction? Your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your iniquity. Because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</p>

  <p>16 Therefore, all those who devour you shall be devoured. And all your adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity. And those who plunder you shall be a spoil, and all who prey upon you I will give for plunder.</p>

  <p>17 For I will restore health to you and heal you of your wounds,' says the LORD, 'because they called you Outcast, saying, "This is Zion, whom no man seeks after."'</p>

  <p>18 Thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob's tents and have mercy on his dwelling places, and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after its manner.</p>

  <p>19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not be few. I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</p>

  <p>20 Their children shall also be as in former time, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all who oppress them.</p>

  <p>21 And their nobles shall be from themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them. And I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach me. For who is this who engaged his heart to approach me?' says the LORD.</p>

  <p>22 'And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.'"</p>

  <p>23 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind. It shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>

  <p>24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return until he has done it and until he has performed the intents of his heart. In the latter days you shall consider it.</p>
