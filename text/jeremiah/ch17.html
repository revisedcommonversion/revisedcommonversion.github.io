    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> The sin of Judah is written<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is engraved upon the tablet of their heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the horns of your altars,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> While their children remember their altars<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their groves by the green trees<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the high hills.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> O my mountain in the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will give your substance and all your treasures as plunder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your high places for sin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />throughout all your borders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And you, even yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I gave you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will cause you to serve your enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the land which you do not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have kindled a fire in my anger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which shall burn forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Cursed is the man who trusts in man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and makes his arm flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose heart departs from the LORD,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For he shall be like the heath in the desert.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall not see when good comes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in a salt land and not inhabited.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose hope is the LORD,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that spreads out its roots by the river.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall not see when heat comes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but its leaf shall be green.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall not be anxious in the year of drought,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The heart is deceitful above all things<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and desperately wicked. Who can know it?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> I, the LORD, search the heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I try the mind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to give every man according to his ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and according to the fruit of his doings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> As the partridge sits on eggs and does not hatch them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so he who gets riches, and not by right,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall leave them in the midst of his days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and at his end shall be a fool."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> A glorious high throne from the beginning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is the place of our sanctuary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> O LORD, the hope of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all who forsake you shall be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who depart from me shall be written in the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have forsaken the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the fountain of living waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Save me, and I shall be saved,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are my praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, they say to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where is the word of the LORD? Let it come now."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have I desired the woeful day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You know that which was uttered by my lips was right before you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Do not be a terror to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are my hope in the day of evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Let them be confounded who persecute me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but do not let me be confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be dismayed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but do not let me be dismayed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bring upon them the day of evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy them with double destruction.</p>

  <p>19 Thus the LORD said to me: "Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem, 20 And say to them, 'Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates. 21 Thus says the LORD: "Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; 22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day; neither do any work, but hallow the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. 23 But they did not obey, nor incline their ear, but made their neck stiff so that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</p>

  <p>24 "And it shall come to pass, if you diligently listen to me," says the LORD, "to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day and do no work therein, 25 Then there shall enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses—they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—and this city shall remain forever. 26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the plain, from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt-offerings, sacrifices, food-offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of the LORD. 27 But if you will not listen to me to hallow the sabbath day, and to bear no burdens while entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched."'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.8] - The part of this verse speaking of the tree was in the KJV in the feminine gender. It has been changed to the neuter here to clarify that the tree is the subject of the illustration given in this part of the comparison from verse 6.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "I, the LORD, search the heart" - Reference, 1st Chronicles 28:9, 29:17; Psalms 7:9; Proverbs 17:3; Jeremiah 11:20; Romans 8:27; 1st Thessalonians 2:4; Revelation 2:23.</p>
