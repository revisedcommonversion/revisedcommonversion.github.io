    <p class="ch-outline">Jeremiah laments the Jews for their manifold sins, 1-8; and for their judgment, 9-11. Disobedience is the cause of their bitter calamity, 12-16.

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Oh that my head were waters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my eyes a fountain of tears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I might weep day and night<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the slain of the daughter of my people!</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Oh that I had in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a lodging-place of way-faring men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I might leave my people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and go from them!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they are all adulterers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />an assembly of treacherous men.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; "And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they proceed from evil to evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they do not know me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; "Everyone take heed of his neighbor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not trust in any brother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for every brother will utterly supplant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and every neighbor will walk slanderously.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; And they will each deceive his neighbor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not speak the truth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have taught their tongue to speak lies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they weary themselves to commit iniquity.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Your habitation is in the midst of deceit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Through deceit they refuse to know me,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I will melt them and try them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For what else shall I do<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the daughter of my people?</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Their tongue is as an arrow shot out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It speaks deceit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in his heart he lies in wait.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Shall I not visit them for these things?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Shall my soul not be avenged<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on such a nation as this?</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For the mountains I will take up a weeping and wailing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they are burned up so that no one can pass through them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither can men hear the voice of the cattle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Both the bird of the heavens and the beast have fled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are gone.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;And I will make Jerusalem heaps<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a den of jackals,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will make the cities of Judah desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without an inhabitant."</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 Who is the wise man who may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken so that he may declare it? For why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness so that no one passes through? 13 And the LORD says, "Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein, 14 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them," 15 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. 16 I will also scatter them among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>17&emsp;Thus says the LORD of hosts:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Consider, and call for the mourning women so that they may come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and send for skillful women so that they may come.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;And let them make haste and take up a wailing for us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that our eyes may run down with tears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'How we are laid waste!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because our dwellings have cast us out.'"</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Yet hear the word of the LORD, O women,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your ear receive the word of his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and teach your daughters wailing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and each her neighbor lamentation.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;For death has come up into our windows<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has entered into our palaces<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cut off the children from outside<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the young men from the streets.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Speak, "Thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Even the carcasses of men shall fall<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as dung upon the open field<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as the handful after the harvester,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall gather them.'"</p>
  </div>

  <p>23 Thus says the LORD: "Do not let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might. Do not let the rich man glory in his riches. 24 But let him who glories, glory in this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I delight," says the LORD.</p>

  <p>25 "Behold, the days come," says the LORD, "that I will punish all those who are circumcised with the uncircumcised: 26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who are in the utmost corners who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart."</p>
