  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "If you will return, O Israel,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"return to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if you will put away your abominations out of my sight<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not wander,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Then you shall swear, 'The LORD lives,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the nations shall bless themselves in him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in him they shall glory."</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Break up your fallow ground<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not sow among thorns.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take away the foreskins of your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest my fury come forth like fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and burn so that none can quench it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the evil of your doings."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Declare in Judah and publish in Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say, "Blow the trumpet in the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cry, gather together, and say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Assemble yourselves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let us go into the fortified cities.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Set up the standard toward Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Retire, do not stay,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will bring evil from the north,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a great destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The lion has come up from his thicket,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has gone forth from his place<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to make your land desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your cities shall be laid waste<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without an inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For this gird yourself with sackcloth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lament, and howl,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the fierce anger of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has not turned back from us."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> "And it shall come to pass at that day,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that the heart of the king<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heart of the princes shall perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the priests shall be astonished<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prophets shall wonder."</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'You shall have peace,' whereas the sword reaches to the soul."</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />toward the daughter of my people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />not to fan, nor to cleanse,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Even a full wind from those places shall come to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now I will also give sentence against them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> "Behold, he shall come up as clouds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His horses are swifter than eagles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Woe to us! For we are laid waste."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may be saved.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How long shall your vain thoughts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lodge within you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For a voice declares from Dan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and publishes affliction from mount Ephraim.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> "Make mention to the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, publish against Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Watchers come from a far country<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> As keepers of a field<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are against her on all sides<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because she has been rebellious against me,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Your way and your doings have procured<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />these things to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This is your wickedness because it is bitter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because it reaches to your heart."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> My anguish, my anguish!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am pained at my very heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart makes a noise in me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I cannot hold my peace<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you have heard, O my soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sound of the trumpet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the alarm of war.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Destruction upon destruction is cried,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the whole land is laid waste.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Suddenly my tents are ruined<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my curtains in a moment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> How long shall I see the standard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "For my people are foolish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have not known me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are foolish children<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they have no understanding.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are wise to do evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to do good they have no knowledge."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> I beheld the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold, it was without form and void,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heavens, and they had no light.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> I beheld the mountains, and behold, they trembled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the hills moved lightly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I beheld, and behold, there was no man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> I beheld, and behold, the fruitful place was a wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all its cities were broken down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the presence of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by his fierce anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> For thus the LORD has said:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"The whole land shall be desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet I will not make a full end.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> For this the earth shall mourn<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heavens above shall be black.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I have spoken it and I have purposed it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not repent, neither will I turn back from it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> The whole city shall flee<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall go into thickets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and climb up upon the rocks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every city shall be forsaken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not a man dwells therein.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> And when you are laid waste, what will you do?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though you clothe yourself with crimson,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though you rend your face with painting,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in vain you shall make yourself fair.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your lovers will despise you. They will seek your life.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the voice of the daughter of Zion who bewails herself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who spreads her hands, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Woe is me now! For my soul is wearied<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of murderers."</p>
