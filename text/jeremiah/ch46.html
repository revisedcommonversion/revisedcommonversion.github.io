  <p>1 [<span class="it">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 [<span class="it">Against Egypt. Concerning the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, who was by the Euphrates River in Carshemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Order the buckler and shield<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and draw near to battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Harness the horses and mount, you horsemen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stand forth with your helmets.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Furbish the spears and put on the coats of mail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their mighty ones are beaten down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have fled apace, and do not look back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for fear was on all sides," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Do not let the swift flee away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the mighty man escape!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall stumble and fall<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />toward the north by the Euphrates River.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Who is this who comes up as a flood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose waters are moved as the rivers?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Egypt rises up like a flood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his waters are moved like the rivers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he says, "I will go up and cover the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will destroy the city and its inhabitants."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Come up, you horses, and rage, you chariots,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the mighty men come forth—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Cushites and the Libyans who handle the shield,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Lydians who handle and bend the bow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a day of vengeance, so that he may avenge himself of his adversaries.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the sword shall devour and shall be satiated<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made drunk with their blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the north country by the Euphrates River.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Go up into Gilead and take balm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O virgin, the daughter of Egypt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In vain you shall use many medicines,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you shall not be cured.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The nations have heard of your shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your cry has filled the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they have fallen both together.</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 [<span class="it">The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "Declare in Egypt, publish in Migdol,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Say, 'Stand fast and prepare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the sword shall devour around you.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Why are your valiant men swept away?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They did not stand because the LORD drove them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He made many to fall.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even one fell upon another.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they said, 'Arise, and let us go back to our own people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the land of our nativity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the oppressing sword.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They cried there, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has passed the time appointed.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> As I live," says the King,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose name is the LORD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"surely as Tabor is among the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as Carmel by the sea, so he shall come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> O daughter dwelling in Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />furnish yourself to go into captivity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for Noph shall be waste and desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />without an inhabitant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Egypt is like a very fair heifer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but destruction comes. It comes out of the north.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Also her hired men are in the midst of her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like fattened bulls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they also have turned back<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have fled away together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They did not stand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because the day of their calamity had come upon them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the time of their visitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The voice thereof shall go like a serpent,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall march with an army<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and come against her with axes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as hewers of wood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> They shall cut down her forest," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"though it cannot be searched<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they are more than the swarming-locusts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are innumerable.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north."</p>
  </div>

  <p>25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel says, "Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods and their kings—even Pharaoh and all those who trust in him— 26 And I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old," says the LORD.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> "But do not fear, O my servant Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not be dismayed, O Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for behold, I will save you from afar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your offspring from the land of their captivity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And Jacob shall return and be in rest and at ease,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall make him afraid.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Do not fear, O Jacob my servant," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"for I am with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make a full end of all the nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where I have driven you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I will not make a full end of you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but correct you in measure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet I will not leave you wholly unpunished."</p>
