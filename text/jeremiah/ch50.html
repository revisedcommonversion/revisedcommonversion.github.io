  <p>1 [<span class="it">The word that the LORD spoke against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Declare among the nations and publish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set up a standard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Publish, and do not conceal.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Say, 'Babylon is taken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bel is confounded. Merodach is broken in pieces.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her idols are confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her images are broken in pieces.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For out of the north there comes a nation against her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which shall make her land desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall dwell in it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall flee, they shall depart—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both man and beast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> "In those days and in that time," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"the children of Israel shall come—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they and the children of Judah together—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />going and weeping.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall go and seek the LORD their God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They shall ask the way to Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with their faces toward it, saying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "My people have been lost sheep.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their shepherds have caused them to go astray.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have turned them away on the mountains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have gone from mountain to hill.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have forgotten their resting-place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All who found them have devoured them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their adversaries said, 'We do not offend<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have sinned against the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the habitation of justice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Flee out of the midst of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and go forth from the land of the Chaldeans,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be as the male goats before the flocks.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For behold, I will raise and cause to come against Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />an assembly of great nations from the north country.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall set themselves in array against her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From there she shall be taken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No one shall return in vain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And Chaldea shall be plundered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All who plunder her shall be satisfied," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> "Because you were glad, because you rejoiced,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O destroyers of my heritage,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you have grown fat as the heifer at grass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bellow as bulls,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Your mother shall be greatly confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She who bore you shall be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, the hindmost of the nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but it shall be wholly desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Everyone who goes by Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Put yourselves in array against Babylon on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All you who bend the bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shoot at her, spare no arrows,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for she has sinned against the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Shout against her on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She has given her hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her foundations have fallen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her walls are thrown down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Since it is the vengeance of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />take vengeance upon her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As she has done, do to her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Cut off the sower from Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For fear of the oppressing sword they shall each turn to his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall each flee to his own land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> "Israel is a scattered sheep.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lions have driven him away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />First the king of Assyria has devoured him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has broken his bones.</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">'Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as I have punished the king of Assyria.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And I will bring Israel back to his habitation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his soul shall be satisfied<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> In those days and in that time,' says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there shall be none,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the sins of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall not be found,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will pardon those whom I reserve.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> "Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and against the inhabitants of Pekod.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Waste and utterly destroy after them," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and do according to all that I have commanded you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> A sound of battle is in the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of great destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> How the hammer of the whole earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is cut apart and broken!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How Babylon has become<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a desolation among the nations!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> I have laid a snare for you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you are also taken, O Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you were not aware.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are found and also caught<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you have striven against the LORD."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The LORD has opened his armory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Come against her from the utmost border.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Open her store-houses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let nothing of her be left.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Slay all her bulls.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them go down to the slaughter.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Woe to them! For their day has come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the time of their visitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> The voice of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />declares in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the vengeance of his temple.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> "Call together the archers against Babylon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All you who bend the bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />encamp against it on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let none thereof escape.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Recompense her according to her work.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to all that she has done, do to her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for she has been proud against the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Therefore, her young men shall fall in the streets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> "Behold, I am against you, O most proud,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />says the Lord GOD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"for your day has come,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the time that I will visit you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And the most proud shall stumble and fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall raise him up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will kindle a fire in his cities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall devour all around him."</p>
  </div>

  <p>33 Thus says the LORD of hosts:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The children of Israel and the children of Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />were oppressed together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And all who took them captives held them fast.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They refused to let them go.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Their Redeemer is strong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD of hosts is his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will thoroughly plead their cause<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may give rest to the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> A sword is upon the Chaldeans," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"and upon the inhabitants of Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> A sword is upon the liars,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be foolish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A sword is upon her mighty men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be dismayed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> A sword is upon their horses, upon their chariots,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon all the mingled people who are in the midst of her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall become as women.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A sword is upon her treasures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be robbed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> A drought is upon her waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be dried up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For it is the land of engraved images,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they are mad upon their idols.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> Therefore, the wild beasts of the desert and the wolves shall dwell there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the owls shall dwell therein.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And it shall be no longer inhabited forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the neighboring cities," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"so shall no man abide there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> Behold, a people shall come from the north,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a great nation, and many kings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be raised up from the borders of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> They shall hold the bow and the lance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are cruel and will not show mercy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their voice shall roar like the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall ride upon horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />each put in array, like a man to the battle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against you, O daughter of Babylon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> The king of Babylon has heard their report<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his hands became feeble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Anguish took hold of him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pangs as of a woman in travail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> "Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the habitation of the strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I will make them suddenly run away from her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who is a chosen man whom I may appoint over her?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For who is like me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who will appoint me the time?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who is that shepherd who will stand before me?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> Therefore, hear the counsel of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that he has taken against Babylon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also his purposes that he has purposed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against the land of the Chaldeans.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the cry is heard among the nations.</p>
