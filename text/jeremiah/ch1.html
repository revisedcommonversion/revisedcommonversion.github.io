  <p>1 [<span class="it">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</span> 2 <span class="it">To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</span> 3 <span class="it">It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</span>]</p>

  <p>4 Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>

  <p>5 "Before I formed you in embryo I knew you. And before you were born I sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the nations."</p>

  <p>6 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a child."</p>

  <p>7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am a child,' for you shall go to all whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.</p>

  <p>8 Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you," says the LORD.</p>

  <p>9 Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</p>

  <p>10 Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out, to pull down, to destroy, to throw down, to build, and to plant."</p>

  <p>11 Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see a rod of an almond-tree." 12 Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well. For I will hasten my word to perform it."</p>

  <p>13 And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, and its face is toward the north." 14 Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. 15 For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north," says the LORD, "and they shall come and shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around and against all the cities of Judah. 16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. 17 Therefore, gird up your loins, arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them. 18 For behold, I have made you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land. 19 And they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you," says the LORD, "to deliver you."</p>
