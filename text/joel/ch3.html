  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/joel/MHC%20-%20Joel%2C%20Chapter%203.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Joel, Chapter 3</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter, which some make the fourth, contains a prophecy of God's judgments on all the antichristian nations at the time of the Jews' conversion, and the reasons of them (verses 1-3); a threatening of Tyre and Zidon, by way of retaliation, for carrying the riches of the Jews into their temples, and selling their persons to the Greeks (verses 4-8); an alarm to prepare for the battle of Armageddon, or the destruction that shall be made in the valley of Jehoshaphat (verses 9-15); and after that an account of the happy state of the church of Christ, their safety and security, plenty, prosperity, and purity, to the end of the world (verses 16-21).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "the valley of Jehoshaphat" - This is a valley near Jerusalem that was likely named after Jehoshaphat because he either built or did some great works there. It is also possible that no proper name was intended here, but rather the valley be named, "the valley of judgment," from the Hebrew word, <span class="gr-heb">יהושפט</span>> (yeh-ho-shaw-fawt'), which means Yahweh-judged. In that case, Jehoshaphat would signify the judgment of God.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "the valley of Jehoshaphat" - See the note for verse 2.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - "the valley of decision" - From John Gill's Exposition: "The same with the valley of Jehoshaphat before mentioned; which shows that not any valley of that name is intended, but a certain place so called from the judgments of God in it; and here named 'the valley of decision,' because here their judgment will be determined... and at this time the controversy between God, and his people's enemies, will be decided, and at an end." The word <span class="it">decision</span> has also been interpreted as concision (from the Latin Vulgate), as in the valley of concision, where the nations gathered together in it will be cut to pieces. It can also be interpreted as threshing, as in the valley of threshing, where the enemies of the Jews will be threshed, or beaten soundly, for the Hebrew word, <span class="gr-heb">החרוץ</span> (khaw-roots'), refers to a threshing instrument used by the Jews.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - Reference, Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24.</p>
