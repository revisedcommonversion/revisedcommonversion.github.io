    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sound an alarm on my holy mountain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the day of the LORD comes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is near at hand,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> A day of darkness and of gloominess,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a day of clouds and of thick darkness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As the morning spreading upon the mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so there is a great and strong people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There has never been the like,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall there be any more after it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to the years of many generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A fire devours before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behind them a flame burns.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The land is as the garden of Eden before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behind them a desolate wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and nothing shall escape them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Their appearance is as the appearance of horses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And as horsemen, so they shall run.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Like the noise of chariots<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on the tops of mountains they shall leap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the noise of a flame of fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that devours the stubble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a strong people set in battle array.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Before their face the people shall be much pained.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All faces shall gather blackness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They shall run like mighty men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall climb the wall like men of war.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall each march on his ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall not break their ranks,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Neither shall one thrust another.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall each walk in his path.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And when they fall upon the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall not be wounded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They shall run to and fro in the city.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall run upon the wall.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall climb upon the houses.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The earth shall quake before them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The heavens shall tremble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sun and the moon shall be dark,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And the LORD will utter his voice before his army,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his camp is very great,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he is strong who executes his word.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the day of the LORD is great and very terrible.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who can endure it?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> "Yet even now," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"turn to me with all your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And rend your heart and not your garments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and turn to the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and repents of the evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Who knows if he will return and repent<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and leave a blessing behind him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even a food-offering and a drink-offering<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the LORD your God?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion. Sanctify a fast.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Call a solemn assembly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Gather the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sanctify the congregation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Assemble the elders.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Gather the children<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who nurse from the breasts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the bridegroom go forth from his room<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the bride out of her chamber.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />weep between the porch and the altar,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let them say, "Spare your people, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not give your heritage to reproach<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the heathen should rule over them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why should they say among the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Where is their God?'"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Then the LORD will be jealous for his land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pity his people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And the LORD will answer and say to his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, I will send you grain, wine, and oil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall be satisfied with it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will no longer make you a reproach among the heathen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> But I will remove far from you the northern army<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drive him into a land barren and desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with his face toward the east sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his back parts toward the utmost sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his odious scent shall come up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his ill savor shall come up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he has worked proudly."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Do not fear, O land. Be glad and rejoice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD will do great things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the pastures of the wilderness spring,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the tree bears its fruit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fig-tree and the vine yield their strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Be glad then, children of Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rejoice in the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he has given you the former rain moderately.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will cause to come down for you the rain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And the floors shall be full of wheat<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> "And I will restore to you the years that the swarming-locust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the licking-locust, the ravaging-locust, and the cutting-locust consumed—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my great army which I sent among you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And you shall eat in plenty, be satisfied,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and praise the name of the LORD your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has dealt wondrously with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And my people shall never be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that I am the LORD your God, and no one else.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And my people shall never be ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And it shall come to pass afterward,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your old men shall dream dreams,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your young men shall see visions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> And also upon the men-servants and upon the women-servants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in those days I will pour out my Spirit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> And I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the moon into blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> And it shall come to pass, that whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be delivered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For on mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be deliverance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the LORD has said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the remnant whom the LORD calls."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/joel/MHC%20-%20Joel%2C%20Chapter%202.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Joel, Chapter 2</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter a further account is given of the judgment of the various locusts, or of those who are designed by them (verses 1-11); the people of the Jews are called to repentance, humbleness, and fasting, urged from the grace and goodness of God, his jealousy and pity for his people, and the answer of prayer that might be expected from him upon this, even to the removal of the calamity (verses 12-20); a prophecy of good things, both temporal and spiritual, in the times of the Messiah, is delivered out as matter and occasion of great joy (verses 21-27); and another concerning the outpouring of the Spirit, which was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (verses 28-29); and the chapter is concluded with the judgments and desolations that should come upon the land of Judea after this, for their rejection of Christ, though the remnant according to the election of grace should be delivered and saved from the general destruction (verses 30-32).</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Reference, Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24.</p>
  <p>[v.13] - "rend your heart and not your garments" - Reference, Psalm 62:8, 95:8.</p>
  <p>[v.20a] - "the northern army" - This is likely an allusion to the Chaldeans and the Assyrians who were to the north of Judea.</p>
  <p>[v.20b] - "with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea" - That is, from the Salt Sea (east of the Jews) to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
  <p>[v.25] - "the swarming-locust, the licking-locust, the ravaging-locust, and the cutting-locust" - See the note for Joel 1:4.</p>
  <p>[v.28-32] - Quoted in Acts 2:17-21.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - Reference, Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24.</p>
  <p>[v.32] - Quoted in Romans 10:13.</p>
