  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/joel/MHC%20-%20Joel%2C%20Chapter%201.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Joel, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter describes a dreadful calamity upon the people of the Jews, by various locusts and drought. After the title of the book (verse 1); old men are called upon to observe this sore judgment to their children, that it might be transmitted to the latest posterity, that the likes of which had not been seen and heard of (verses 2-4); and drunkards are to awake and weep, because the vines were destroyed, and no wine could be made for them (verses 5-7); and not only farmers and vine-dressers, but also the priests of the Lord are called to mourn, because such destruction was made in the fields and vineyards that there was no food-offering nor drink-offering brought into the house of the Lord (verses 8-13); therefore a general and solemn fast is required throughout the land, because of the distress of man and beast (verses 14-18); and the chapter is concluded with the resolution of the prophet to cry to the Lord, on account of this calamity (verses 19-20).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "Joel" - From Yhovah and 'el; Yahweh (is his) God.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - This verse lists four different types of locusts. They have their names based on a property of the species, though the actual species is unknown. The first mentioned is the cutting-locust (called the palmer-worm in the KJV), which sheers or crops off the fruits and leaves of trees. The second is the swarming-locust (sometimes just called the locust), which were known from their vast increase, the multitude they bring forth and the large numbers in which they appear. The third is the licking-locust (called the canker-worm or caterpillar in the KJV), which in the Hebrew language is called because of its licking up the fruits of the earth, by which the land becomes barren. The licking-locust is also known as the devourer. The fourth is the ravaging-locust (called the caterpillar in the KJV), which has its name from wasting and consuming all that comes in its way. All of these types of locusts came separately and subsequently over a period of time, over the course of some years, as is mentioned in Joel 2:25.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "apple-tree" - The Hebrew word, tappuwach (tap-poo'-akh), is typically rendered as either apple or apple tree (from its fragrance), but it can also refer to a citrus tree, both of which are fragrant trees when in bloom.</p>
  <p>[v.20a] - "The beasts of the field also cry to you" - Job 38:41; Psalm 104:21, 27-28, 145:15, 147:9; Matthew 6:26; Luke 12:24.</p>
  <p>[v.20b] - "pastures" - The word, dwellings, may also be used here. The Hebrew word is, na'ah (naw-aw'), which can mean habitation, house, pasture, or pleasant place.</p>
