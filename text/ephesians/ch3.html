    <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">The hidden mystery that the Gentiles should be saved was made known to Paul by revelation, 1-7; and to him that grace was given so that he should preach it, 8-12. He desires that they not faint for his tribulation, 13; and prays that they may perceive the great love of Christ toward them, 14-21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 For this cause, I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 2 If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me on your account, 3 That by revelation he made the mystery known to me, as I wrote before in few words, 4 By which when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, 5 Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, 6 That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel, 7 Of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power. 8 To me, who am less than the least of all saints, this grace was given so that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ, 10 To the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in heavenly places, 11 According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. 12 In him we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 13 Therefore, I desire that you do not faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
  
  <p>14 For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 That he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, 17 So that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, length, depth, and height, 19 And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
  
  <p>20 Now to him who is able to do the more abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, 21 To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/ephesians/MHC%20-%20Ephesians%2C%20Chapter%203.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Ephesians, Chapter 3</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.6a] - "fellow-heirs, fellow-members..., and fellow-partakers" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "They do not get this blessing indirectly through the Jews, or by becoming Jews, but directly, as Gentiles; and they become fellow-heirs, fellow-members, and fellow-partakers 'in Christ Jesus,' enjoying all privileges in him, in a state of union and fellowship with him." On another note, "fellow-" was added to each word in this sequence of three words in order to match a sort of symmetry in the Greek words used here.</p>
  <p>[v.6b] - "fellow-members of the body" - From Thayer's Greek Lexicon: "Belonging to the same body (i.e., metaphorically, to the same church) (R.V.: fellow-members of the body)." This word occurs only in this verse.</p>
  <p>[v.21a] - "generations" - Literally, "ages," as in the time ordinarily occupied by each successive generation (Thayer's Greek Lexicon).</p>
  <p>[v.21b] - "forever and ever" - Literally, "of the age of the ages."</p>
