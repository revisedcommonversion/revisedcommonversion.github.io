    <p class="ch-outline">The duty of children toward their parents, 1-4; of servants toward their masters, 5-9. Our life is a warfare, not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual enemies, 10-12. The complete armor of a Christian, 13-17; and how it ought to be used, 18-20.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2 "<cite>Honor your father and mother</cite>"—which is the first commandment with promise— 3 "<cite>So that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.</cite>"</p>
  
  <p>4 And fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the instruction and admonition of the Lord.</p>
  
  <p>5 Servants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ, 6 Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, 7 With good will doing service, as to the Lord and not to men, 8 Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same he will receive from the Lord, whether he is bond or free.</p>
  
  <p>9 And masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening, knowing that your Master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.</p>
  
  <p>10 Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. 11 Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13 Therefore, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14 Stand therefore, having your "<cite>loins girded in truth,</cite>" and having on the "<cite>breast-plate of righteousness,</cite>" 15 And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace, 16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked. 17 And take the "<cite>helmet of salvation,</cite>" and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching for this purpose with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. 19 And pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me so that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, 20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds, so that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
  
  <p>21 But so that you also may know my affairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things, 22 Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, so that you may know our affairs and that he may comfort your hearts.</p>
  
  <p>23 Peace be to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24 May grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</p>
