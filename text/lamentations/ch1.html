  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains a complaint of the miseries of the city of Jerusalem and the nation of the Jews, first by the Prophet Jeremiah, then by the Jewish people, and is concluded with a prayer of theirs. The prophet deplores the state of the city, now depopulated and having become tributary, which had been full of people and ruled over others, but now in a very mournful condition and forsaken and ill used by her lovers and friends, turned her enemies (Lamentations 1:1-2); and next the state of the whole nation, being carried captive for their sins among the Heathens, having no rest, being overtaken by their persecutors (Lamentations 1:3); but what most of all afflicted him was the state of Zion, her ways mourning, her solemn feasts neglected, her gates desolate, her priests sighing and virgins afflicted, her adversaries prosperous, her beauty departed, her sabbaths mocked, her nakedness seen, and all her pleasant things in the sanctuary seized on by the adversary, and all this because of her many transgressions, grievous sins, and great pollution and vileness, which are confessed (Lamentations 1:4-11); then the people themselves, or the prophet representing them, lament their case and call upon others to sympathize with them (Lamentations 1:12); observing the sad desolation made by the hand of the Lord upon them for their iniquities (Lamentations 1:13-15); on account of which great sorrow is expressed, and their case is represented as the more distressing that they had no comforter (Lamentations 1:16-17); then follows a prayer to God in which his righteousness in doing or suffering all this is acknowledged, and mercy is entreated for themselves and judgments on their enemies (Lamentations 1:18-22).</p>
