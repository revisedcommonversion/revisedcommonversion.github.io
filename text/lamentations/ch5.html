    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Consider and behold our reproach.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Our inheritance is turned to strangers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />our houses to foreigners.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> We are orphans and fatherless.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our mothers are as widows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> We have drank our water for money.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our wood is sold to us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Our necks are under persecution.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We labor and have no rest.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> We have given the hand to the Egyptians<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Our fathers have sinned and are no more,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we have borne their iniquities.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Servants have ruled over us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no one who delivers us out of their hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> We procured our bread with the peril of our lives,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Our skin was black like an oven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the terrible famine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> They ravished the women in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the virgins in the cities of Judah.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Princes were hanged by their hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The faces of elders were not honored.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They took the young men to grind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the children fell under the wood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The elders have ceased from the gate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the young men from their music.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The joy of our heart has ceased.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our dance is turned into mourning.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The crown has fallen from our head.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Woe to us, that we have sinned!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For this our heart is faint,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for these things our eyes are dim,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The foxes walk upon it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> You, O LORD, remain forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your throne is from generation to generation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Why do you forget us forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and forsake us for such a long time?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Turn us to you, O LORD, and we shall be turned.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Renew our days as of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> But you have utterly rejected us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are very angry against us.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter are reckoned up the various calamities and distresses of the Jews in Babylon, which the Lord is desired to remember and consider (Lamentations 5:1-16); their great concern for the desolation of the temple in particular is expressed (Lamentations 5:17-18); and the chapter is concluded with a prayer that God would show favor to them, turn them to him, and renew their prosperity as of old, though he had rejected them and been angry with them (Lamentations 5:19-22).</p>
