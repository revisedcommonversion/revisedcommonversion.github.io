  <p>1 Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us. Consider and behold our reproach.</p>

  <p>2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.</p>

  <p>3 We are orphans and fatherless. Our mothers are as widows.</p>

  <p>4 We have drank our water for money. Our wood is sold to us.</p>

  <p>5 Our necks are under persecution. We labor and have no rest.</p>

  <p>6 We have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread.</p>

  <p>7 Our fathers have sinned and are no more, and we have borne their iniquities.</p>

  <p>8 Servants have ruled over us. There is no one who delivers us out of their hand.</p>

  <p>9 We procured our bread with the peril of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>

  <p>10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</p>

  <p>11 They ravished the women in Zion and the maids in the cities of Judah.</p>

  <p>12 Princes were hanged by their hand. The faces of elders were not honored.</p>

  <p>13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</p>

  <p>14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.</p>

  <p>15 The joy of our heart has ceased. Our dance is turned into mourning.</p>

  <p>16 The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, that we have sinned!</p>

  <p>17 For this our heart is faint, for these things our eyes are dim,</p>

  <p>18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate. The foxes walk upon it.</p>

  <p>19 You, O LORD, remain forever. Your throne is from generation to generation.</p>

  <p>20 Why do you forget us forever and forsake us for such a long time?</p>

  <p>21 Turn us to you, O LORD, and we shall be turned. Renew our days as of old.</p>

  <p>22 But you have utterly rejected us. You are very angry against us.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter are reckoned up the various calamities and distresses of the Jews in Babylon, which the Lord is desired to remember and consider (Lamentations 5:1-16); their great concern for the desolation of the temple in particular is expressed (Lamentations 5:17-18); and the chapter is concluded with a prayer that God would show favor to them, turn them to him, and renew their prosperity as of old, though he had rejected them and been angry with them (Lamentations 5:19-22).</p>
