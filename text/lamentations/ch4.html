  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The prophet begins this chapter with a complaint of the ill usage of the dear children of God and precious sons of Zion (Lamentations 4:1-2); relates the dreadful effects of the famine during the siege of Jerusalem (Lamentations 4:3-10); the taking and destruction of that city he imputes to the wrath of God, and represents it as incredible to the kings and inhabitants of the earth (Lamentations 4:11-12); the causes of which were the sins of the prophets, priests, and people (Lamentations 4:13-16); expresses the vain hopes they once had, but now were given up entirely, their king being taken (Lamentations 4:17-20); and the chapter is concluded with a prophecy of the destruction of the Edomites and of the return of the Jews from captivity (Lamentations 4:21-22).</p>
