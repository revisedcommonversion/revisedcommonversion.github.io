  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 How the gold has become dim! How the most fine gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</p>

  <p>2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</p>

  <p>3 Even the jackals draw out the breast to nurse their young ones. The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>4 The tongue of the nursing child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst. The young children ask for bread, and no man breaks it for them.</p>

  <p>5 Those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets. Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>

  <p>6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</p>

  <p>7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow. They were whiter than milk. They were more ruddy in body than rubies. Their polishing was of sapphire.</p>

  <p>8 Their visage is blacker than a coal. They are not known in the streets. Their skin cleaves to their bones. It is withered. It has become like a stick.</p>

  <p>9 Those who are slain with the sword are better than those who are slain with hunger, for these pine away, stricken through for lack of the fruits of the field.</p>

  <p>10 The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children. They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD has accomplished his fury. He has poured out his fierce anger and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured her foundations.</p>

  <p>12 The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>13 It is for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</p>

  <p>14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets. They have polluted themselves with blood so that men could not touch their garments.</p>

  <p>15 They cried to them, "Depart. It is unclean. Depart, depart. Do not touch." When they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, "They shall no longer sojourn there."</p>

  <p>16 The anger of the LORD has divided them. He will no longer regard them. They did not respect the persons of the priests. They did not favor the elders.</p>

  <p>17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help. In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</p>

  <p>18 They hunt our steps so that we cannot go in our streets. Our end is near. Our days are fulfilled, for our end has come.</p>

  <p>19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of heaven. They pursued us upon the mountains. They laid wait for us in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen."</p>

  <p>21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who dwells in the land of Uz. The cup shall also pass through to you. You shall be drunken and shall make yourself naked.</p>

  <p>22 The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion. He will no longer carry you away into captivity. He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom. He will disclose your sins.</p>
