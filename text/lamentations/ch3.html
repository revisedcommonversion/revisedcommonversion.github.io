  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>

  <p>2 He has led me and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</p>

  <p>3 Surely against me he is turned. He turns his hand against me all the day.</p>

  <p>4 My flesh and my skin he has made old. He has broken my bones.</p>

  <p>5 He has built against me and compassed me with gall and labor.</p>

  <p>6 He has set me in dark places, as those who are dead of old.</p>

  <p>7 He has hedged me about so that I cannot get out. He has made my chain heavy.</p>

  <p>8 Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.</p>

  <p>9 He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone. He has made my paths crooked.</p>

  <p>10 He was to me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places.</p>

  <p>11 He has turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate.</p>

  <p>12 He has bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>

  <p>13 He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</p>

  <p>14 I was a derision to all my people and their song all the day.</p>

  <p>15 He has filled me with bitterness. He has made me drunken with wormwood.</p>

  <p>16 He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones. He has covered me with ashes.</p>

  <p>17 And you have removed my soul far off from peace. I forgot prosperity.</p>

  <p>18 And I said, "My strength and my hope has perished from the LORD."</p>

  <p>19 Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</p>

  <p>20 My soul has them still in remembrance and is humbled in me.</p>

  <p>21 This I recall to my mind; therefore, I have hope.</p>

  <p>22 It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions do not fail.</p>

  <p>23 They are new every morning. Your faithfulness is great.</p>

  <p>24 "The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore, I will hope in him."</p>

  <p>25 The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.</p>

  <p>26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</p>

  <p>27 It is good for a man that he should bear the yoke in his youth.</p>

  <p>28 He sits alone and keeps silence because he has borne it upon him.</p>

  <p>29 He puts his mouth in the dust, if there may be hope.</p>

  <p>30 He gives his cheek to him who smites him. He is filled full with reproach.</p>

  <p>31 For the Lord will not cast off forever.</p>

  <p>32 But though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

  <p>33 For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</p>

  <p>34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</p>

  <p>35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</p>

  <p>36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord does not approve.</p>

  <p>37 Who is he who speaks and it comes to pass when the Lord does not command it?</p>

  <p>38 Out of the mouth of the most High, does evil and good not proceed?</p>

  <p>39 Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>

  <p>40 Let us search and try our ways and turn back to the LORD.</p>

  <p>41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</p>

  <p>42 We have transgressed and have rebelled. You have not pardoned.</p>

  <p>43 You have covered with anger and persecuted us. You have slain. You have not pitied.</p>

  <p>44 You have covered yourself with a cloud so that our prayer should not pass through.</p>

  <p>45 You have made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</p>

  <p>46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>

  <p>47 Fear and a snare has come upon us, desolation and destruction.</p>

  <p>48 My eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

  <p>49 My eye trickles down and does not cease without any intermission,</p>

  <p>50 Until the LORD looks down and beholds from heaven.</p>

  <p>51 My eye affects my heart because of all the daughters of my city.</p>

  <p>52 My enemies chased me fiercely, like a bird without cause.</p>

  <p>53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me.</p>

  <p>54 Waters flowed over my head. Then I said, "I am cut off."</p>

  <p>55 I called upon your name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</p>

  <p>56 You have heard my voice. Do not hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>

  <p>57 You drew near in the day that I called upon you. You said, "Do not fear."</p>

  <p>58 O Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul. You have redeemed my life.</p>

  <p>59 O LORD, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause.</p>

  <p>60 You have seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.</p>

  <p>61 You have heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me,</p>

  <p>62 The lips of those who rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>

  <p>63 Behold their sitting down and their rising up. I am their music.</p>

  <p>64 Render to them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</p>

  <p>65 Give them sorrow of heart, your curse to them.</p>

  <p>66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</p>
