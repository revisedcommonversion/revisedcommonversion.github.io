  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/lamentations/MHC%20-%20Lamentations%2C%20Chapter%202.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Lamentations, Chapter 2</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains another alphabet in which the Prophet Jeremiah, or those he represents, lament the sad condition of Jerusalem, the destruction of the city and temple and of all persons and things relative to them and to its civil or church state, and that as being from the hand of the Lord himself, who is represented all along as the author thereof, because of their sins (Lamentations 2:1-9); and then the elders and virgins of Zion are represented as in great distress and weeping for those desolations, which were very much owing to the false prophets who had deceived them (Lamentations 2:10-14); and all this occasioned great rejoicing in the enemies of Zion (Lamentations 2:15-17); but sorrow of heart to Zion herself, who is called to weeping (Lamentations 2:18-19); and the chapter is concluded with an address to the Lord to take this her sorrowful case into consideration and show pity and compassion (Lamentations 2:20-22).</p>
