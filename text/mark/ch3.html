  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand. 2 And they watched him to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him. 3 And he says to the man who had the withered hand, "<span class="woc">Stand forth.</span>" 4 And he says to them, "<span class="woc">Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath or to do evil, to save life or to kill?</span>" But they held their peace. 5 And when he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he says to the man, "<span class="woc">Stretch forth your hand.</span>" And he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other. 6 And the Pharisees went forth and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>

  <p>7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, 8 From Jerusalem, from Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude came to him when they had heard what great things he did. 9 And he told his disciples that a small boat should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 10 For he had healed many; therefore, as many as had diseases pressed upon him to touch him. 11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried, saying, "You are the Son of God." 12 And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</p>

  <p>13 And he goes up upon a mountain and calls to him whom he wished, and they came to him. 14 And he ordained twelve so that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach, 15 To have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out demons: 16 Simon he surnamed Peter, 17 James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder), 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Canaanite, 19 And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. They went into a house.</p>

  <p>20 And the multitude comes together again so that they could not so much as eat bread. 21 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold upon him, for they said, "He is beside himself." 22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem, said, "He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the demons he casts out demons." 23 And he called them to him and said to them in parables, "<span class="woc">How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> 24 <span class="woc">And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> 25 <span class="woc">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> 27 <span class="woc">No man can enter into a strong man's house and seize his goods unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</span></p>

  <p>28 "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, the sons of men shall be forgiven of all sins and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme.</span> 29 <span class="woc">But he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal condemnation</span>"— 30 Because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."</p>

  <p>31 Then his brothers and his mother came there, and standing outside they sent to him, calling him. 32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said to him, "Behold, your mother and your brothers outside seek for you." 33 And he answered them, saying, "<span class="woc">Who is my mother, or my brothers?</span>" 34 And he looked around at those who sat about him, and said, "<span class="woc">Behold, my mother and my brothers!</span> 35 <span class="woc">For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, my sister, and mother.</span>"</p>
