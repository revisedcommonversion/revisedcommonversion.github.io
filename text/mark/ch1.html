  <p>1 [<span class="it">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 As it is written in the prophets, "'<cite>Behold, I send my messenger before your face who shall prepare your way before you.</cite>'</p>

  <p>3 '<cite>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, "Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight."</cite>'"</p>

  <p>4 John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. 5 And all the land of Judea and those of Jerusalem went out there to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. 6 And John was clothed with camel's hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey, 7 And preached, saying, "There comes after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 8 I indeed have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</p>

  <p>9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 10 And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. 11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</p>

  <p>12 And immediately the Spirit drives him into the wilderness. 13 And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him.</p>

  <p>14 Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 15 And saying, "<span class="woc">The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the gospel.</span>"</p>

  <p>16 Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. 17 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Come after me and I will make you become fishers of men.</span>" 18 And immediately they forsook their nets and followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little farther from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets. 20 And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and went after him.</p>

  <p>21 And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught. 22 And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, 24 Saying, "Leave us alone. What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâ€”the Holy One of God." 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "<span class="woc">Hold your peace and come out of him.</span>" 26 And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed; therefore, they questioned among themselves, saying, "What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him." 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region around Galilee.</p>

  <p>29 And immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 30 But the mother of Simon's wife lay sick with a fever, and immediately they tell him of her. 31 And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered to them.</p>

  <p>32 And at evening when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were diseased and those who were possessed with demons. 33 And all the city was gathered at the door. 34 And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. And he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him.</p>

  <p>35 And in the morning, rising a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place and prayed there. 36 And Simon and those who were with him followed after him. 37 And when they had found him, they said to him, "All men seek for you." 38 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Let us go into the next towns so that I may preach there also, for I have come for this purpose.</span>" 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out demons.</p>

  <p>40 And there came a leper to him, imploring him, and kneeling down to him and saying to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand and touched him, and says to him, "<span class="woc">I am willing. Be clean.</span>" 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed. 43 And he strictly charged him and immediately sent him away, 44 And says to him, "<span class="woc">See that you say nothing to any man. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span>" 45 But he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter; therefore, Jesus could no longer openly enter into the city, but was outside in desolate places. And they came to him from every quarter.</p>
