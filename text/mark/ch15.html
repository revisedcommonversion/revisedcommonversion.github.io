    <p class="ch-outline">Jesus brought bound and accused before Pilate, 1-5. Upon the clamor of the common people, the murderer Barabbas is released and Jesus delivered up to be crucified, 6-15.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, and bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 2 And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he, answering, said to him, "<span class="woc">You say it.</span>" 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things, but he answered nothing. 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, "Do you answer nothing? Behold how many things they testify against you." 5 But Jesus still answered nothing; therefore, Pilate marveled.</p>

  <p>6 Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner whom they desired. 7 And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with those who had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 8 And the multitude crying aloud, began to desire him to do as he had always done for them. 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you wish that I release to you the King of the Jews?" 10 (For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.) 11 But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 12 And Pilate answered and said again to them, "What do you wish then that I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 13 And they cried out again, "Crucify him." 14 Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has he done?" And they cried out the more exceedingly, "Crucify him." 15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</p>

  <p>16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they call together the whole band. 17 And they clothed him with purple, platted a crown of thorns, put it around his head, 18 And began to salute him: "Hail, King of the Jews!" 19 And they struck him on the head with a reed, spit upon him, and bowing their knees, worshiped him. 20 And when they had mocked him, they took the purple from off of him, put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>

  <p>21 And they constrained someone who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to bear his cross.</p>

  <p>22 And they bring him to the place Golgotha (which is, being interpreted, The Place of a Skull). 23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not receive it. 24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 25 And it was the third hour and they crucified him. 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written above, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</p>

  <p>27 And with him they crucified two thieves: one on his right hand and the other on his left. 28 And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, "<cite>And he was numbered with the transgressors.</cite>" 29 And those who passed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ah, you who destroy the temple and build it in three days, 30 Save yourself and come down from the cross." 31 Likewise, the chief priests, also mocking, said among themselves with the scribes, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself. 32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross so that we may see and believe." And those who were crucified with him reviled him.</p>

  <p>33 And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "<span class="woc"><cite>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</cite></span>" (which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?") 35 And some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah." 36 And someone ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait. Let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down." 37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice and expired. 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. 39 And when the centurion who stood over against him saw that he thus cried out and expired, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God."</p>

  <p>40 There were also women looking on at a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and Joseph), Salome 41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him), and many other women who came with him to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>42 And now, when the evening had come, because it was the preparation (that is, the day before the sabbath), 43 Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable counselor, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate and petitioned for the body of Jesus. 44 And Pilate marveled that he was already dead. And calling the centurion, he asked him whether he had already been dead. 45 And when he knew it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 And he bought fine linen, took him down, wrapped him in the linen, laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher. 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph beheld where he was laid.</p>
