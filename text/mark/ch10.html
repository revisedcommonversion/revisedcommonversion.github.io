  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he arose from there and comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. And the people resort to him again, and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.</p>

  <p>2 And the Pharisees came to him testing him, and asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?" 3 And he answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">What did Moses command you?</span>" 4 And they said, "Moses '<cite>allowed a man to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away.</cite>'" 5 And Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</span> 6 <span class="woc">But from the beginning of the creation, '<cite>God made them male and female.</cite>'</span> 7 <span class="woc">'<cite>For this cause a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife,</cite></span> 8 <span class="woc"><cite>And the two of them become one flesh,</cite>' so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> 9 <span class="woc">Therefore, what God has joined together, do not let man separate.</span>"</p>

  <p>10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. 11 And he says to them, "<span class="woc">Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</span> 12 <span class="woc">And if a woman puts away her husband and is married to another, she commits adultery.</span>"</p>

  <p>13 And they brought young children to him so that he might touch them, and his disciples rebuked those who brought them. 14 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said to them, "<span class="woc">Allow the little children to come to me and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> 15 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter it.</span>" 16 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>

  <p>17 And when he had gone forth into the way, someone came running, kneeled to him, and asked him, "Good Master, what shall I do so that I may inherit eternal life?" 18 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Why do you call me good? No one is good, but one: God.</span> 19 <span class="woc">You know the commandments, '<cite>Do not commit adultery,</cite>' '<cite>Do not kill,</cite>' '<cite>Do not steal,</cite>' '<cite>Do not bear false witness,</cite>' '<cite>Do not defraud,</cite>' and, '<cite>Honor your father and mother.</cite>'</span>" 20 And he answered and said to him, "Master, all these I have observed from my youth." 21 Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him and said to him, "<span class="woc">You lack one thing: go and sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come, take up the cross, and follow me.</span>" 22 And he was sad at that saying and went away grieved, for he had great possessions.</p>

  <p>23 And Jesus looked around and says to his disciples, "<span class="woc">How hardly those who have riches shall enter into the kingdom of God!</span>" 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, "<span class="woc">Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> 25 <span class="woc">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>" 26 And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, "Who then can be saved?" 27 And Jesus looking upon them, says, "<span class="woc">With men it is impossible, but not with God. For with God all things are possible.</span>"</p>

  <p>28 Then Peter began to say to him, "Behold, we have left all and have followed you." 29 Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or lands for my sake and the gospel's,</span> 30 <span class="woc">Who shall not receive one hundred-fold now in this time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.</span> 31 <span class="woc">But many who are first shall be last, and the last first.</span>"</p>

  <p>32 And they were on the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them. And they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid. And again he took the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen to him, 33 Saying, "<span class="woc">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will deliver him to the Gentiles,</span> 34 <span class="woc">And they will mock him, scourge him, spit upon him, and kill him. But on the third day he will rise again.</span>"</p>

  <p>35 And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, "Master, we wish that you should do for us whatever we desire." 36 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">What do you wish that I should do for you?</span>" 37 They said to him, "Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand and the other on your left hand in your glory." 38 But Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">You do not know what you ask. Can you drink of the cup that I drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span>" 39 And they said to him, "We can." And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">You shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of, and with the baptism that I am baptized with you shall be baptized.</span> 40 <span class="woc">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give. It shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</span>"</p>

  <p>41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. 42 But Jesus called them, and says to them, "<span class="woc">You know that those who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</span> 43 <span class="woc">But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your minister,</span> 44 <span class="woc">And whoever of you wishes to be the chief shall be servant of all.</span> 45 <span class="woc">For even the Son of man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom for many.</span>"</p>

  <p>46 And they came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging. 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me." 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace, but he cried the more a great deal: "Son of David, have mercy on me." 49 And Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, "Be of good comfort. Rise. He calls you." 50 And casting away his garment, he rose and came to Jesus. 51 And Jesus answered and said to him, "<span class="woc">What do you wish that I should do to you?</span>" The blind man said to him, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." 52 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Go, your faith has made you whole.</span>" And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the way.</p>
