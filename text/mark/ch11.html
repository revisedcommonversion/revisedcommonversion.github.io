  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples, 2 And says to them, "<span class="woc">Go into the village over against you. And as soon as you have entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, on which never a man sat. Loose him and bring him.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And if any man says to you, 'Why do you do this?' say that the Lord has need of him, and immediately he will send him here.</span>" 4 And they went and found the colt tied by the door outside in a place where two ways met, and they loose him. 5 And some of those who stood there, said to them, "What are you doing loosing the colt?" 6 And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded, and they let them go. 7 And they brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him, and he sat upon him. 8 And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches off trees and strewed them in the way.</p>

  <p>9 And those who went before and those who followed cried, saying, "Hosanna! '<cite>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</cite>'</p>

  <p>10 Blessed is the kingdom of our Father David that comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest."</p>

  <p>11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple. And when he had looked around at all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>

  <p>12 And on the next day, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry, 13 And seeing a fig-tree afar off having leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find anything on it. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs had not yet come. 14 And Jesus answered and said to it, "<span class="woc">Let no man eat fruit of you hereafter forever.</span>" And his disciples heard it.</p>

  <p>15 And they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves, 16 And would not allow any man to carry any vessel through the temple. 17 And he taught, saying to them, "<span class="woc">Is it not written, '<cite>My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer</cite>'? But you have made it '<cite>a den of thieves.</cite>'</span>" 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him, for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.</p>

  <p>19 And when evening had come, he went out of the city.</p>

  <p>20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots. 21 And Peter calling to remembrance, says to him, "Master, behold, the fig-tree which you cursed has withered." 22 And Jesus answering, says to them, "<span class="woc">Have faith in God.</span> 23 <span class="woc">For truly I say to you, that whoever says to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that the things which he says shall come to pass, he shall have whatever he says.</span> 24 <span class="woc">Therefore, I say to you, whatever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them.</span> 25 <span class="woc">And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven may also forgive you of your trespasses.</span> 26 <span class="woc">But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</span>"</p>

  <p>27 And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders, 28 And say to him, "By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority to do these things?" 29 And Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">I will also ask of you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> 30 <span class="woc">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</span>" 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 32 But if we say, 'From men'—" They feared the people, for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed. 33 And they answered and said to Jesus, "We cannot tell." And Jesus answering says to them, "<span class="woc">Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>"</p>
