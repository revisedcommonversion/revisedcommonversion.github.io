  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, "Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!" 2 And Jesus answering said to him, "<span class="woc">Do you see these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.</span>"</p>

  <p>3 And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, over against the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 4 "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are fulfilled?" 5 And Jesus answering them, began to say, "<span class="woc">Take heed lest any man deceive you.</span> 6 <span class="woc">For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am Christ,' and will deceive many.</span> 7 <span class="woc">And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled, for such things must come. But the end will not be yet.</span> 8 <span class="woc">For nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, there will be earthquakes in diverse places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.</span></p>

  <p>9 "<span class="woc">But take heed to yourselves. For they will deliver you up to councils, and in the synagogues you will be beaten, and you will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them.</span> 10 <span class="woc">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</span> 11 <span class="woc">But when they lead you and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand of what you shall speak, neither premeditate. But whatever is given to you in that hour, speak it, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> 12 <span class="woc">Now the brother will betray the brother to death, and the father the son. And children will rise up against their parents and will cause them to be put to death.</span> 13 <span class="woc">And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end, the same shall be saved.</span></p>

  <p>14 "<span class="woc">But when you see '<cite>the abomination of desolation</cite>' spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> 15 <span class="woc">And he who is on the house-top must not go down into the house, neither enter it, to take anything out of his house.</span> 16 <span class="woc">And he who is in the field must not turn back again to take up his garment.</span> 17 <span class="woc">But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse infants in those days.</span> 18 <span class="woc">And pray that your flight is not in the winter.</span> 19 <span class="woc">For in those days there shall be affliction such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall there be.</span> 20 <span class="woc">And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.</span> 21 <span class="woc">And then, if any man says to you, 'Behold, here is Christ,' or, 'Behold, he is there,' do not believe him.</span> 22 <span class="woc">For false Christs and false prophets will rise and will show signs and wonders to lead astray, if it were possible, even the elect.</span> 23 <span class="woc">But take heed. Behold, I have foretold you all things.</span></p>

  <p>24 "<span class="woc">But in those days, after that tribulation, '<cite>the sun shall be darkened, the moon shall not give her light,</cite></span> 25 <span class="woc"><cite>The stars of heaven shall fall,</cite>' and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And then they shall see '<cite>the Son of man coming in the clouds</cite>' with great power and glory.</span> 27 <span class="woc">And then he will send his angels and will assemble his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</span></p>

  <p>28 "<span class="woc">Now learn a parable of the fig-tree: when its branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> 29 <span class="woc">Thus you, in a like manner, when you see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.</span> 30 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass until all these things are done.</span> 31 <span class="woc">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> 32 <span class="woc">But of that day and that hour no man knows, not even the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</span></p>

  <p>33 "<span class="woc">Take heed, watch and pray, for you do not know when the time is.</span> 34 <span class="woc">For the Son of man is like a man taking a long journey, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, each to his work, and commanded the gatekeeper to watch.</span> 35 <span class="woc">Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house comes—at evening, at midnight, at the cock-crowing, or in the morning—</span> 36 <span class="woc">Lest coming suddenly, he should find you sleeping.</span> 37 <span class="woc">And what I say to you, I say to all: 'Watch.'</span>"</p>
