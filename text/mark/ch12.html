  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he began to speak to them by parables. "<span class="woc">A certain man planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine-vat, built a tower, lent it out to farmers, and went into a far country.</span> 2 <span class="woc">And at the season, he sent to the farmers a servant so that he might receive from the farmers some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And they caught him, beat him, and sent him away empty.</span> 4 <span class="woc">And again, he sent to them another servant, and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled.</span> 5 <span class="woc">And again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some and killing some.</span> 6 <span class="woc">Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, 'They will reverence my son.'</span> 7 <span class="woc">But those farmers said among themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours.'</span> 8 <span class="woc">And they took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</span> 9 <span class="woc">What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and will give the vineyard to others.</span> 10 "<span class="woc">And have you not read this Scripture:</span></p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse"><span class="woc">'<cite>The stone which the builders rejected<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has become the head of the corner.</cite></span></p>

    <p>11&emsp;<span class="woc"><cite>This was the Lord's doing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it is marvelous in our eyes</cite>'?</span>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 And they sought to lay hold upon him, but feared the people, for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them. And they left him and departed.</p>

  <p>13 And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in his words. 14 And when they had come, they say to him, "Master, we know that you are true and care for no man, for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 15 Shall we give, or shall we not give?" But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "<span class="woc">Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so that I may see it.</span>" 16 And they brought it, and he says to them, "<span class="woc">Whose image and superscription is this?</span>" And they said to him, "Caesar's." 17 And Jesus answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.</span>" And they wondered at him.</p>

  <p>18 Then the Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked him, saying, 19 "Master, Moses wrote to us, '<cite>If a man's brother dies and leaves his wife and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise children for his brother.</cite>' 20 Now there were seven brothers: the first took a wife, and dying left no children; 21 And the second took her and died, neither did he leave any children; and the third likewise; 22 And the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died. 23 In the resurrection therefore, when they rise, whose wife shall she be of them? For the seven had her for a wife." 24 And Jesus answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">Do you not therefore err because you do not know the Scriptures, neither the power of God?</span> 25 <span class="woc">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels who are in heaven.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, '<cite>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</cite>'?</span> 27 <span class="woc">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You therefore greatly err.</span>"</p>

  <p>28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, "Which is the first commandment of all?" 29 And Jesus answered him, "<span class="woc">The first of all the commandments is, '<cite>Hear, O Israel. The Lord our God is one Lord.</cite></span> 30 <span class="woc"><cite>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.</cite>' This is the first commandment.</span> 31 <span class="woc">And the second is like it, namely this: '<cite>You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</cite>' There is no other commandment greater than these.</span>" 32 And the scribe said to him, "Right, Master, you have said the truth, for there '<cite>is one God,</cite>' '<cite>and there is no other but he.</cite>' 33 And to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices." 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, "<span class="woc">You are not far from the kingdom of God.</span>" And no man after that dared ask him any question.</p>

  <p>35 And while he taught in the temple, Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">How do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David?</span> 36 <span class="woc">For David himself said by the Holy Spirit,</span></p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse"><span class="woc">'<cite>The LORD said to my Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Sit on my right hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."</cite>'</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>37 <span class="woc">Therefore, David himself calls him Lord, and how is he then his son?</span>" And the common people heard him gladly.</p>

  <p>38 And he said to them in his doctrine, "<span class="woc">Beware of the scribes who love to go in long clothing, love salutations in the market-places,</span> 39 <span class="woc">The chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts,</span> 40 <span class="woc">Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These shall receive greater condemnation.</span>"</p>

  <p>41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury. And many who were rich cast in much. 42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a quadrans. 43 And he called his disciples and says to them, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all those who have cast into the treasury.</span> 44 <span class="woc">For they all cast in of their abundance, but she of her lack cast in all that she had, even all her living.</span>"</p>
