  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days, and it was understood that he was in the house. 2 And immediately many were assembled so that there was no room to receive them, not even at the door. And he preached the word to them. 3 And they come to him, bringing someone paralyzed who was carried by four men. 4 And when they could not come near to him by reason of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken it up, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "<span class="woc">Son, your sins are forgiven.</span>" 6 But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 "Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God only?" 8 And immediately, when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they thus reasoned within themselves, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Why do you reason these things in your hearts?</span> 9 <span class="woc">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed, and walk'?</span> 10 <span class="woc">But so that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins</span>"—he says to the paralytic— 11 "<span class="woc">I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go into your house.</span>" 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all. Therefore, they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw it in this fashion."</p>

  <p>13 And he went forth again by the sea-side, and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</p>

  <p>14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alpheus, sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, "<span class="woc">Follow me.</span>" And he arose and followed him.</p>

  <p>15 And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at the table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they followed him. 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "How is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?" 17 When Jesus heard it, he says to them, "<span class="woc">Those who are in health have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span>"</p>

  <p>18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting, and they come, and say to him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" 19 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> 20 <span class="woc">But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span></p>

  <p>21 "<span class="woc">No man also sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment, or else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old and the rent is made worse.</span> 22 <span class="woc">And no man puts new wine into old bottles, or else the new wine bursts the bottles, and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred. But new wine must be put into new bottles.</span>"</p>

  <p>23 And it came to pass, that he went through the grain-fields on the sabbath, and his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they made their way. 24 And the Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do on the sabbath that which is not lawful?" 25 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he and those who were with him—</span> 26 <span class="woc">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the show-bread, which it is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?</span>" 27 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath.</span> 28 <span class="woc">Therefore, the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span>"</p>
