  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death. 2 But they said, "Not on the feast-day, lest there should be an uproar of the people."</p>

  <p>3 And being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and she broke the box and poured it on his head. 4 And there were some who had indignation within themselves, and said, "Why was this waste of the ointment made? 5 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor." And they murmured against her. 6 And Jesus said, "<span class="woc">Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has wrought a good work on me.</span> 7 <span class="woc">For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you wish, you may do them good. But you do not always have me.</span> 8 <span class="woc">She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</span> 9 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial to her.</span>"</p>

  <p>10 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them. 11 And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>

  <p>12 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said to him, "Where do you wish that we go and prepare so that you may eat the passover?" 13 And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, "<span class="woc">Go into the city, and there a man shall meet you bearing a pitcher of water. Follow him.</span> 14 <span class="woc">And wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, 'The Master says, "Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"'</span> 15 <span class="woc">And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared. Make ready for us there.</span>" 16 And his disciples went and came into the city and found as he had said to them. And they made ready the passover.</p>

  <p>17 And in the evening he comes with the twelve. 18 And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, one of you who eats with me will betray me.</span>" 19 And they began to be sorrowful and to say to him one by one, "Is it I?" And another said, "Is it I?" 20 And he answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">It is one of the twelve who dips with me in the dish.</span> 21 <span class="woc">The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written concerning him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.</span>"</p>

  <p>22 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "<span class="woc">Take, eat. This is my body.</span>" 23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. 24 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">This is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many.</span> 25 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until the day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span>"</p>

  <p>26 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 27 And Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">All of you will be offended because of me this night, for it is written, 'I will <cite>smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</cite>'</span> 28 <span class="woc">But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>" 29 But Peter said to him, "Even though all shall be offended, yet I will not." 30 And Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that this day, even in this night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times.</span>" 31 But he spoke the more vehemently, "If I should die with you, I will not deny you in any way." They all also said likewise.</p>

  <p>32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane. And he says to his disciples, "<span class="woc">Sit here while I pray.</span>" 33 And he takes with him Peter, James, and John and began to be greatly amazed and to be very heavy, 34 And says to them, "<span class="woc">My soul is exceedingly sorrowful to death. Remain here and watch.</span>" 35 And he went forward a little, fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. 36 And he said, "<span class="woc">Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.</span>" 37 And he comes and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, "<span class="woc">Simon, do you sleep? Could you not watch one hour?</span> 38 <span class="woc">Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</span>" 39 And again he went away, prayed, and spoke the same words. 40 And when he returned, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy), neither did they know what to answer him. 41 And he comes the third time, and says to them, "<span class="woc">Sleep on now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> 42 <span class="woc">Rise, let us go. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.</span>"</p>

  <p>43 And immediately while he was yet speaking, Judas comes, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders. 44 And he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Take him and lead him away safely." 45 And as soon as he had come, he goes immediately to him, and says, "Master, master," and kissed him. 46 And they laid their hands on him and took him. 47 And one of those who stood by drew a sword, smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. 48 And Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and with staffs to take me?</span> 49 <span class="woc">I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not take me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.</span>" 50 And they all forsook him and fled.</p>

  <p>51 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body, and the young men laid hold upon him. 52 And he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.</p>

  <p>53 And they led Jesus away to the high priest. And with him all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled. 54 And Peter followed him at a distance, even into the palace of the high priest, and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire. 55 And the chief priests and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death, and found none. 56 For many bore false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree together. 57 And some rose up and bore false testimony against him, saying, 58 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.'" 59 But neither in this way did their testimony agree together. 60 And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, "Do you answer nothing? What is it which these testify against you?" 61 But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" 62 And Jesus said, "<span class="woc">I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and '<cite>coming in the clouds of heaven.</cite>'</span>" 63 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and says, "What need do we have of any further witnesses? 64 You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. 65 And some began to spit on him, to cover his face, to buffet him, and to say to him, "Prophesy." And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.</p>

  <p>66 And as Peter was below in the palace, there comes one of the maids of the high priest. 67 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "And you were also with Jesus of Nazareth." 68 But he denied, saying, "I do not know, neither do I understand what you say." And he went out into the porch and the cock crowed. 69 And a maid saw him again and began to say to those who stood by, "This is one of them." 70 And he denied it again. And a little after, those who stood by said again to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees thereto." 71 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, "I do not know this man of whom you speak." 72 And the second time the cock crowed. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him: "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>
