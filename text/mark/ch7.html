    <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">The Pharisees find fault with the disciples for eating with unwashed hands, 1-7. They break the commandment of God by the traditions of men, 8-13. Nothing from outside a man can defile him, 14-23.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who came from Jerusalem came together to him. 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is to say with unwashed) hands, they found fault. 3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands often, holding the tradition of the elders. 4 And when they come from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, pots, brazen vessels, and tables. 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?"</p>

  <p>6 He answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Isaiah has prophesied well concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, '<cite>This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</cite></span></p>

  <p>7 <span class="woc"><cite>But in vain they worship me, teaching the commandments of men for doctrines.</cite>'</span></p>

  <p>8 <span class="woc">For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups. And you do many other similar things.</span>"</p>

  <p>9 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">You full well reject the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition,</span> 10 <span class="woc">For Moses said, '<cite>Honor your father and your mother,</cite>' and, '<cite>Whoever curses father or mother, let him die the death.</cite>'</span> 11 <span class="woc">But you say, 'If a man says to his father or mother, "Whatever you might be profited by me is Corban," (that is to say, a gift to God) he shall be free.'</span> 12 <span class="woc">And you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</span> 13 <span class="woc">Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions, which you have delivered. And you do many similar things.</span>"</p>

  <p>14 And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Listen to me each of you, and understand.</span> 15 <span class="woc">There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him can defile him; however, it is the things which come out of him that defile the man.</span> 16 <span class="woc">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span>"</p>

  <p>17 And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 18 And he says to them, "<span class="woc">Are you so void of understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from outside enters into the man, it cannot defile him,</span> 19 <span class="woc">Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and goes out into the latrine, purging all kinds of food?</span>" 20 And he said, "<span class="woc">That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> 21 <span class="woc">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts: adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> 22 <span class="woc">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</span> 23 <span class="woc">All these evil things come from within and defile the man.</span>"</p>

  <p>24 And from there he arose, went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, entered into a house, and wished to have no man know it, but he could not be hid. 25 But a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet 26 (The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation), and she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter. 27 But Jesus said to her, "<span class="woc">Let the children first be satisfied, for it is not proper to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs.</span>" 28 And she answered and said to him, "Yes, Lord, yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs." 29 And he said to her, "<span class="woc">For this saying, depart. The demon has gone out of your daughter.</span>" 30 And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>

  <p>31 And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. 32 And they bring to him someone who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they implore him to put his hand upon him. 33 And he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears, and having spit he touched his tongue. 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed and says to him, "<span class="woc">Effatha,</span>" (that is, "Be opened"). 35 And immediately his ears were opened, the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly. 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it, 37 And were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."</p>
