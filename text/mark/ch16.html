  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James), and Salome had bought sweet spices so that they might come and anoint him. 2 And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun. 3 And they said among themselves, "Who shall roll away the stone from the door of the sepulcher for us?" 4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was very great. 5 And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment, and they were frightened. 6 And he says to them, "Do not be frightened. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold the place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him, as he said to you.'" 8 And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher, for they trembled and were amazed. They did not say anything to any man, for they were afraid.</p>

  <p>9 Now when Jesus had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons. 10 And she went and told those who had been with him as they mourned and wept. 11 And they, when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe.</p>

  <p>12 After that, he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking and going into the country. 13 And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them.</p>

  <p>14 Afterward, he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was risen. 15 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.</span> 16 <span class="woc">He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.</span> 17 <span class="woc">And these signs shall follow those who believe: in my name they shall cast out demons, they shall speak in new languages,</span> 18 <span class="woc">They shall take up serpents, if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them, and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.</span>"</p>

  <p>19 So then after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. 20 And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.</p>
