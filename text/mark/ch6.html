  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he went out from there and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. 2 And when the sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue. And many who heard him were astonished, saying, "From where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 3 Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon? And are his sisters not here with us?" And they were offended at him. 4 But Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, among his own kindred, and in his own house.</span>" 5 And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons and healed them. 6 And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.</p>

  <p>7 And he calls the twelve to him and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits. 8 And he commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only—no bag, no bread, no money in their purse— 9 But to be shod with sandals and not put on two coats. 10 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">In whatever place you enter into a house, abide there until you depart from that place.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And whoever does not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.</span>" 12 And they went out and preached that men should repent. 13 And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.</p>

  <p>14 And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore, mighty works show themselves forth in him." 15 Others said, "It is Elijah." And others said, "It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets." 16 But when Herod heard of him, he said, "It is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."</p>

  <p>17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her. 18 For John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." 19 Therefore, Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him, but she could not, 20 For Herod feared John and kept him safe, knowing that he was a just and holy man. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed, yet he heard him gladly. 21 And when a convenient day had come, Herod on his birthday made a supper for his lords, high captains, and chief men of Galilee. 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who sat with him. And the king said to the damsel, "Ask of me whatever you wish and I will give it to you." 23 And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, to the half of my kingdom." 24 And she went forth and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist." 25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I wish that you would give me at once the head of John the Baptist in a dish." 26 And the king was exceedingly sorry. Yet for his oath's sake and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her. 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in the prison, 28 And brought his head in a dish and gave it to the damsel. And the damsel gave it to her mother. 29 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</p>

  <p>30 And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. 31 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Come separately into a desolate place and rest a while.</span>" For there were many coming and going and they did not even have opportunity to eat. 32 And they departed into a desolate place in a boat privately.</p>

  <p>33 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him. And they ran there together on foot out of all cities and went ahead of them. 34 And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. 35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, "This is a desolate place and now the time is far passed. 36 Send them away so that they may go into the country around and into the villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat." 37 He answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">You give them something to eat.</span>" And they say to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?" 38 He says to them, "<span class="woc">How many loaves do you have? Go and see.</span>" And when they knew, they say, "Five, and two fish." 39 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. 40 And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties. 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them. He also divided the two fish among them all. 42 And they all ate and were satisfied. 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fish. 44 And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men.</p>

  <p>45 And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat and to go to the other side ahead of him to Bethsaida while he sent the people away. 46 And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray.</p>

  <p>47 And when evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land. 48 And he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them. And about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them. 49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out. 50 (For they all saw him and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and says to them, "<span class="woc">Be of good cheer. It is I. Do not be afraid.</span>" 51 Then he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered. 52 For they did not consider the miracle of the loaves, but their heart was hardened.</p>

  <p>53 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore. 54 And when they had come out of the boat, immediately they knew him, 55 And ran throughout that whole region and began to carry around in beds those who were sick where they heard he was. 56 And wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets and implored him that they might touch at least the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were healed.</p>
