    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe to those who devise iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and work evil upon their beds!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the morning is light, they practice it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because it is in the power of their hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And they covet fields and take them by violence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also houses, and take them away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus they oppress a man and his house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even a man and his heritage.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Therefore, thus says the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Behold, against this family I devise an evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from which you shall not remove your necks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall you go haughtily, for this time is evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Therefore, you shall have no one who shall cast the line by lot<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the congregation of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Shall it be said, O house of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Is the Spirit of the LORD shortened?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Are these his doings?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do my words not do good to him who walks uprightly?</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter complaint is made of the sins of the people of Israel, and they are threatened with punishment for them. The sins they are charged with are covetousness, oppression, and injustice, which were premeditated, and done deliberately (verses 1-2); therefore the Lord devised evil against them, they should not escape; and which would bring down their pride, and cause them to take up a lamentation, because they should not enjoy the portion of land that belonged to them (verses 3-5); they are further charged with opposing the prophets of the Lord, the folly and wickedness of which is exposed (verses 6-7); and with great inhumanity and barbarity, even to women and children (verses 8-9); and therefore are ordered to expect and prepare for a removal out of their land (verse 10); and the rather, since they gave encouragement and heed to false prophets, and delighted in them (verse 11); and the chapter is concluded with words of comfort to the remnant among them, and with precious promises of the Messiah, and the blessings of grace by him (verses 12-13).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "this family" - This is referring to the people of Israel (John Owen).</p>
  <p>[v.5] - "cast the line by lot" - That is, divide, or measure with the measuring line, the inheritance of the land. It can also be read as, "divide the land by lot." Reference, Joshua 14:1-5.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "Is the Spirit of the LORD shortened?" - From the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary: "Is His compassion contracted within narrower limits now than formerly, so that He should delight in your destruction (compare Psalm 77:7-9; Isaiah 59:1-2)?"</p>
  <p>[v.8] - "Even of late my people have risen up as an enemy" - This may also be read as, "And those who were formerly my people, have risen up as an enemy against me."</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies" - This is a difficult passage to render in English. Literally, it can be rendered, "If a man, the follower of the spirit and of deception" (John Owen). A man who is a "follower of the spirit" is said to be a prophet, or to profess the office of a teacher (John Calvin). Calvin renders this passage as, "If a man walks in the spirit, and deceitfully lies." The Pulpit Commentary explains the passage as being a hendiadys (a figure of speech used for emphasis, where two words joined by <span class="it">and</span> are used to express a single complex idea) for "a spirit of falsehood," or "a lying spirit," citing 1st Kings 22:22 and comparing with Ezekiel 3:2-3, 17.</p>
