    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Woe is me!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the grape-gleanings of the vintage.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no cluster to eat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My soul desired the first ripe fruit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The godly man has perished from the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no one upright among men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They all lie in wait for blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They each hunt his brother with a net.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it thoroughly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The prince and also the judge ask for a reward.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus they weave it together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The best of them is as a brier.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The day of your watchmen and your visitation comes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now shall be their perplexity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Do not trust in a friend.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not put confidence in a guide.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Keep the doors of your mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from her who lies in your bosom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For the son dishonors the father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the daughter rises up against her mother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A man's enemies are the men of his own house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I will look to the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will wait for the God of my salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My God will hear me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I fall, I shall arise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I sit in darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD will be a light to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I will bear the indignation of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because I have sinned against him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until he pleads my cause<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and executes judgment for me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will bring me forth to the light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I shall behold his righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Then she who is my enemy shall see it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shame shall cover her who said to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where is the LORD your God?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My eyes shall behold her.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now she shall be trodden down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the mire of the streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> In the day that your walls are to be built,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in that day the decree shall be far removed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> In that day they shall also come even to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from Assyria and from the fortified cities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the fortress even to the river,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from sea to sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from mountain to mountain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But the land shall be desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of those who dwell in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the fruit of their doings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Feed your people with your rod,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the flock of your heritage,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who dwell solitarily in the forest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of Carmel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as in the days of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> "According to the days of your departure<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the land of Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will show to them marvelous things."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The nations shall see and be confounded<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at all their might.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall lay their hand upon their mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their ears shall be deaf.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They shall lick the dust like a serpent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall move out of their holes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like worms of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be afraid of the LORD our God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall fear because of you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and passes by the transgression<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the remnant of his heritage?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not retain his anger forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he delights in mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He will return. He will have compassion upon us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will tread our iniquities under foot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you will cast all their sins<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the depths of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You will give the truth to Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the mercy to Abraham,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you have sworn to our fathers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the days of old.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/micah/MHC%20-%20Micah%2C%20Chapter%207.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Micah, Chapter 7</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter begins with a lamentation of the prophet, in the name of the church and people of God, concerning the general depravity and corruption of the times in which he lived (verses 1-6); then declares what he was determined to do for his relief in such circumstances, (verse 7); comforts himself and the church with a good hope and firm belief of its being otherwise and better with them, to the shame and confusion of their enemies that now rejoiced, though without just reason for it (verses 8-10); with promises of deliverance, after a desolation of the land for some time (verses 11-13); and with the answer returned to the prayers of the prophet (verses 14-15); which would issue in the astonishment of the world, and their subjection to the church of God (verses 16-17); and the chapter is concluded with admiration at the pardoning grace and mercy of God, and his faithfulness to his promises (verses 18-20).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "when they have gathered the summer fruits" - Literally, "the gatherings of summer."</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "godly" - Or, "merciful."</p>
  <p>[v.3a] - "the great man" - That is, the rich man.</p>
  <p>[v.3b] - "Thus they weave it together" - In other words, the rich and the judges conspired together. This collusion ties in with the beginning of the verse so that their evil, their perverted justice, would be thoroughly executed.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoted in Matthew 10:35-36.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Reference, Proverbs 24:16; 1st John 5:4.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - "Feed your people with your rod" - This may also be read as, "Shepherd your people with your staff." Here, God is compared with a shepherd, as he often is (Psalm 23; Isaiah 40:11; Jeremiah 31:10; Ezekiel, ch. 34; Amos 3:12; John 10:11-14). The same word from which <span class="it">rod</span> is translated in this verse also translates to <span class="it">scepter</span> when referring to kings.</p>
  <p>[v.16a] - "They shall lay their hand upon their mouth" - That is, they will be silent.</p>
  <p>[v.16b] - "Their ears shall be deaf" - That is, they will be astounded and desire not to hear of any new thing—which would only add to their being in shock.</p>
  <p>[v.17a] - "They shall lick the dust like a serpent" - That is, they will lie face down on the earth, or prostrate themselves.</p>
  <p>[v.17b] - "They shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth." - This can also be read as, "They shall come out of their lurking places like worms and reptiles."</p>
  <p>[v.19a] - "He will return" - "Grotius, Dathius, and Henderson, consider that this verb, placed before another, without a conjunction, expresses only a reiteration; and they render it adverbially, 'again.' But, in this place, it would be better to give it its proper meaning; for as God is said to depart from his people (Hosea 9:12), so he may be said also to return." —John Owen</p>
  <p>[v.19b] - "He will tread our iniquities under foot" - In other words, "He will trample our iniquities," or, "He will subdue (or conquer) our iniquities."</p>
  <p>[v.20] - "You will give" - From John Calvin's Commentary: "That is, show in reality; for this, to give, is, as it were, to exhibit in effect or really. You will then give, that is, openly show, that you have not been in vain so kind to us and ours, in receiving them into favor. How so? Because the effect of your goodness and truth appears to us."</p>
