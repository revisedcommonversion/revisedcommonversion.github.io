    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And many nations shall come and say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the house of the God of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will teach us of his ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we will walk in his paths."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the law shall go forth from Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And he shall judge among many people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rebuke strong nations afar off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall beat their swords into plow-shares<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their spears into pruning-hooks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall they learn war anymore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For all people will each walk in the name of his god,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "In that day," says the LORD, "I will assemble her who is lame.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will gather her who is driven out<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her whom I have afflicted.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains some gracious promises concerning the glory and happiness of the church of Christ in the last days; as of its stability, exaltation, and increase, and of the spread of the Gospel from it (verses 1-2); and of the peace and security of it, and constant profession and exercise of religion in it (verses 3-5); and of the deliverance of it from affliction and distress, and the ample and everlasting kingdom of Christ in it (verses 6-8); and then follow some prophecies more particularly respecting the Jews; as that, though they should be in distress, and be carried captive into Babylon, they should be delivered from there (verses 9-10); and, though many people should be gathered against them, yet should not be able to prevail over them, but their attempts would issue in their own destruction (verses 11-13).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "flow to it" - This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew, but it can also be read as, "assemble there."</p>
  <p>[v.3a] - "pruning-hooks" - Or, "scythes."</p>
  <p>[v.3b] - "neither shall they learn war anymore" - This may also be read as, "neither shall they accustom themselves to war anymore."</p>
  <p>[v.4b] - Reference, Leviticus 26:6.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "And the LORD will reign over them on mount Zion from now on, even forever" - Reference, Psalm 2:6, 125:1; Isaiah 9:6-7; Daniel 7:14, 27; Joel 3:17; Luke 1:33; Revelation 11:15.</p>
  <p>[v.8a] - "tower of the flock" - Concerning this tower, Adam Clarke said, "I believe Jerusalem, or the temple, or both, are meant." John Calvin essentially is in agreement with that, for he said it refers to "the holy city," or Jerusalem.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "look upon" - "To look on, is a Hebrew idiom, and means often to triumph or exalt over another, or to gain the upper hand. See Psalm 22:17, 118:7." —John Owen</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD, neither do they understand his counsel" - Reference, Isaiah 55:8; Jeremiah 29:11; Romans 11:33-34.</p>
  <p>[v.13a] - "horn" - "Horn, in Scripture, means often elevation, dignity, power, strength. It means evidently the last (i.e., strength) here. Zion was made strong to thrash the nations, and supplied with strong hoofs to tread on them." —John Owen</p>
  <p>[v.13b] - "beat... in pieces" - Or, "thrash out." "To thrash and to thrash out, is to conquer and to bring thoroughly under subjection." —John Owen</p>
