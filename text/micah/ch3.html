    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> And I said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you princes of the house of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is it not for you to know judgment?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> You hate the good and love the evil.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You pluck off their skin from them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their flesh from off their bones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You also eat the flesh of my people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and flay their skin from off them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You break their bones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chop them in pieces, as for the pot<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as flesh within the cauldron.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Then you shall cry to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he will not hear you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will even hide his face from you at that time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as you have been ill behaved in your doings."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who deceive my people, who bite with their teeth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cry, "Peace," and he who puts nothing into their mouths,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they even prepare war against him:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "Therefore, night shall be for you so that you shall not have a vision.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And it shall be dark for you so that you shall not divine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the sun shall go down over the prophets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the day shall be dark over them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Then the seers shall be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the diviners confounded.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, they shall all cover their lips,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for there is no answer from God."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of judgment and of might,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to declare to Jacob his transgression<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to Israel his sin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Hear this, I pray you, you heads of the house of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and princes of the house of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who abhor judgment and pervert all equity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They build up Zion with blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Her heads judge for bribes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />her priests teach for payment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her prophets divine for money.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet they will lean upon the LORD and say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Is the LORD not among us?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No evil can come upon us."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, Zion for your sake shall be plowed as a field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Jerusalem shall become heaps,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet reproves and threatens both princes and prophets, first separately, and then conjunctly; first the heads and princes of the people, civil magistrates, for their ignorance of justice, and hatred of good, and love of evil, and for their oppression and cruelty; and they are threatened with distress when they should cry to the Lord, and should not be heard by him (verses 1-4); next the prophets are taken to task, for their voraciousness, avarice, and false prophesying; and are threatened with darkness, with lack of vision, and of an answer from the Lord, and with shame and confusion (verses 5-7); and the prophet being full of the Spirit and power of God, to declare the sins and transgressions of Jacob and Israel (verse 8), very freely declaims against princes, priests, and prophets, all together; who, though guilty of very notorious crimes, yet were in great security, and promised themselves impunity (verses 9-11); therefore the city and temple of Jerusalem are threatened with an utter desolation (verse 12).</p>
  <p>[v.11a] - Reference, Exodus 23:8; Deuteronomy 16:19; Proverbs 15:27, 17:23; Isaiah 1:23; 1st Peter 5:2.</p>
  <p>[v.11b] - "money" - Literally, "silver," but is often understood as money in general.</p>
