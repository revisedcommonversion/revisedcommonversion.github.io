  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, laying aside all malice, all guile, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil-speakings, 2 As new-born babies, desire the pure milk of the word so that you may grow thereby, 3 If indeed you have "<cite>tasted that the Lord is gracious.</cite>"</p>

  <p>4 And coming to him as to a living stone, disallowed indeed by men, but chosen by God, and precious, 5 You also, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>6 Therefore, it is also contained in the Scripture, "<cite>Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, elect, precious. And he who believes in him shall not be confounded.</cite>"</p>

  <p>7 To you therefore who believe, he is precious, but to those who are disobedient, "<cite>The stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</cite>"</p>

  <p>8 And "<cite>a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense,</cite>" even to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which they were also appointed.</p>

  <p>9 But you are "<cite>a chosen generation</cite>", "<cite>a royal priesthood, a holy nation,</cite>" "<cite>a peculiar people, so that you should show forth the praises</cite>" of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, 10 Who, in time past, were not a people, but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>

  <p>11 Dearly beloved, I implore you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, 12 Having your manner of life honest among the Gentiles, so that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God "<cite>on the day of visitation.</cite>"</p>

  <p>13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether to the king as supreme, 14 Or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do well. 15 For thus is the will of God: that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, 16 Even as free men, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 17 Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</p>

  <p>18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unfair. 19 For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully. 20 For what glory is it if, when you are buffeted for your sins, you bear it patiently? But if you do good and suffer for it and you bear it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</p>

  <p>21 For even to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example so that you should follow his steps. 22 He committed no sin, "<cite>neither was guile found in his mouth.</cite>" 23 He, when he was reviled, did not revile in return. When he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously. 24 He himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree so that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness. "<cite>By his stripes you were healed.</cite>" 25 For you were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
