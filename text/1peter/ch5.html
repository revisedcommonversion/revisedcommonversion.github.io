    <p class="ch-outline">Peter exhorts the elders to feed their flocks, 1-4; the younger to obey, 5-7; and all to be sober, watchful, and constant in the faith, 8; and to resist the cruel adversary the devil, 9-14.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 I exhort the elders who are among you as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight of it—not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but from a ready mind; 3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock. 4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you shall receive a crown of glory that does not fade away. 5 Likewise, you younger ones, submit yourselves to the elder. Indeed, all of you be subject to one another and be clothed with humility, for "<cite>God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.</cite>"</p>

  <p>6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that he may exalt you in due time, 7 "<cite>Casting all your care upon him,</cite>" for he cares for you. 8 Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. 9 Resist him steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers who are in the world. 10 But may the God of all grace who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. 11 To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>

  <p>12 By Silvanus our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. 13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you, and so does Mark my son. 14 Greet one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
