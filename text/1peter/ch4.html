  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, since Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 2 So that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 3 For the past time is sufficient to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, having walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries, 4 In which they think it strange that you do not run with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you. 5 They shall give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 6 For this cause the gospel was also preached to those who are dead so that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>

  <p>7 But the end of all things is at hand; therefore, be sober and watch for the purpose of prayer. 8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity will cover a multitude of sins. 9 Be hospitable to one another without grudging. 10 As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same to one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 11 If any man speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If any man ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God gives so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>

  <p>12 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you. 13 But rejoice, seeing you are partakers of Christ's sufferings, so that when his glory is revealed you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, as a thief, as an evildoer, or as a busy-body in other men's matters. 16 Yet if any man suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf. 17 For the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first begins at us, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 "<cite>And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?</cite>" 19 Therefore, let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugk6_vAwipT41MUkp1Vf1JZNoX0_-Dz4D8sUwNZ07Ks/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 1st Peter, Chapter 4</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.8] - "charity will cover a multitude of sins" - From John Gill's Exposition, "Referring to Proverbs 10:12 not a man's own sins, but the sins of others; and not from the sight of God, for from that only the blood and righteousness of Christ cover sins, even all the sins, the whole multitude of the sins of God's elect; but from the sight of men, both of those against whom they are committed, and others; since charity, or true love, thinks no ill, but puts the best constructions upon the words and actions of fellow Christians, and does not take them up, and improve and exaggerate them, but lets them lie buried in oblivion: it takes no notice of injuries, offences, and affronts, but overlooks them, bears with them, and forgives them, so that they are never raked up, and seen any more; which prevents much scandal, strife, and trouble. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, and the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read, 'covereth', as in Proverbs 10:12."</p>
  <p>[v.18] - Quoting Proverbs 11:31 (LXX).</p>
