    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Timothy is exhorted again to constancy and perseverance, and to do the duty of a faithful servant of the Lord in dividing the word rightly and avoiding profane and vain babblings, 1-16. Of Hymeneus and Philetus, 17, 18. The foundation of the Lord is sure, 19-21. He is taught of what to beware, what to follow after, and in what manner the servant of the Lord ought to behave himself, 22-26.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2 And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 3 Therefore, endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 4 No man who wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life so that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier. 5 And if a man also strives for masteries, yet he is not crowned unless he strives lawfully. 6 The farmer who labors must be first partaker of the fruits. 7 Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>

  <p>8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel. 9 For this I suffer trouble as an evil-doer, even to bonds, but the word of God is not bound. 10 Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect so that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>

  <p>11 This is a faithful saying: "For if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him.</p>

  <p>12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</p>

  <p>13 If we do not believe, yet he abides faithful. He cannot deny himself."</p>

  <p>14 Put others in remembrance of these things, charging them before the Lord that they do not contend about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. 15 Give diligence to show yourself approved to God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16 But shun profane and vain babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. 17 And their word will spread like gangrene, of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus, 18 Who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and they overthrow the faith of some. 19 Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity."</p>

  <p>20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. 21 If a man therefore will cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and profitable for the master's use, and prepared to every good work. 22 Flee also youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, and peace, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 23 But avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they engender contentions. 24 And the servant of the Lord must not contend, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient, 25 In meekness instructing those who oppose themselves, if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o74aaghJbV8MWghckiLFvV094WaSF6bz40K8qv9VMI/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Timothy, Chapter 2</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.11] - Reference, Romans 6:8; 1st Thessalonians 5:10.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Matthew 10:33; Luke 12:9.</p>
  <p>[v.13] - Reference, Deuteronomy 7:9.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "Give diligence" - The Greek word, <span class="gr-heb">σπουδάζω</span>, spoudazó (spoo-dad'-zo), means to hasten, make haste, to exert oneself; to make effort, be prompt or earnest, do or give diligence, be diligent, endeavor, labor, study. In the KJV, the word <span class="it">study</span> is used here, as in, "Study to show yourself..." This rendering is probably the most widely known, but the meaning of this use of <span class="it">study</span> is archaic and it does not imply an academic application, as in to study written materials in order to show yourself approved to God. We are to give diligence, or exert ourselves in every way to show ourselves approved to God, and that includes such things as prayer, charity, worship of God, obedience to God, and our overall conduct in life. Studying (in an academic sense) God's Word is also included, but it's only a part and not to be taken as the whole of what is being said in this verse.</p>
