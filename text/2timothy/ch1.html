  <p>1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>

  <p>2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

  <p>3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day, 4 Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy, 5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that is in you also. 6 For this cause I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God which is in you by the imposition of my hands. 7 For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

  <p>8 Do not be therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. 9 He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. 11 For this, I am appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 12 For this cause, I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him for that day. 13 Hold firm to the form of sound words, which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 14 Keep that good thing which was committed to you by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.</p>

  <p>15 This you know, that all those who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my bonds. 17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me. 18 May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day. And in all that he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.</p>
