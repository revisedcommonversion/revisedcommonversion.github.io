  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Know this also, that in the last days perilous times will come. 2 For men will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, lacking self-control, fierce, despisers of those who are good, 4 Traitors, headstrong, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God, 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Turn away from such. 6 For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with diverse lusts, 7 Ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth—men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 9 But they shall proceed no further, for their folly will be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</p>

  <p>10 But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, patience, charity, endurance, 11 Persecutions, and afflictions which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 And indeed all who will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and seducers will become worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14 But continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 And that from a child you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, 17 So that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly furnished to all good works.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/2-timothy/MHC%20-%202nd%20Timothy%2C%20Chapter%203.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Timothy, Chapter 3</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.8] - "Jannes and Jambres" - Reference, Exodus 7:11 (not mentioned by name). From John Calvin's Commentary: "It is generally believed; that the two who are mentioned, 'Jannes and Jambres,' were magicians put forward by Pharaoh. But from what source Paul learned their names is doubtful, except that it is probable, that many things relating to those histories were handed down, the memory of which God never permitted to perish. It is also possible that in Paul's time there were commentaries on the prophets that gave more fully those narratives which Moses touches very briefly. However that may be, it is not at random that he calls them by their names. The reason why there were two of them may be conjectured to have been this, that, because the Lord had raised up for his people two leaders, Moses and Aaron, Pharaoh determined to place against them the like number of magicians."</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Acts 14:22.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - Reference, Romans 10:17.</p>
