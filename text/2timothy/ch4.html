  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom, 2 Preach the word, be instant in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and doctrine. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts they will multiply for themselves teachers, having itching ears, 4 And they will turn away their ears from the truth and will be turned to fables. 5 But watch in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, and make full proof of your ministry.</p>

  <p>6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 7 I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. 8 From now on, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all those also who love his appearing.</p>

  <p>9 Do your diligence to come to me shortly. 10 For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 12 And I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 13 The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring it with you, and also the books, but especially the parchments. 14 Alexander the copper-smith did me much evil—may the Lord reward him according to his works— 15 Of whom you also must be aware, for he has greatly withstood our words.</p>

  <p>16 At my first defense no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. I pray to God that it may not be laid to their charge. 17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me so that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

  <p>19 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 20 Erastus stayed at Corinth, but Trophimus I have left sick at Miletum. 21 Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p>

  <p>22 May the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8-t16PO-wCNhWNKNCoM_b6X4d2cHunxoaPw8bJF10k/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Timothy, Chapter 4</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.16] - "defense" - From the Greek word, <span class="gr-heb">απολογια</span>, apologia (ap-ol-og-ee'-ah), meaning, a verbal defense, or a speech in defense (Thayer's Greek Lexicon). The Pulpit Commentary explains this a little further by saying, "The technical word in classical Greek for a defense in answer to an accusation."</p>
  <p>[v.17] - "And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion" - From John Gill's Exposition: "from death he was threatened with, which, like a lion, gaped upon him to devour him; or from Satan the roaring lion, who desired to have had him, and sought to have intimidated him, and brought him to have denied his Lord, to have deserted his cause, and blasphemed his name; or else from Nero the Roman emperor, so called from his power and fierceness. So Tiberius is called by Marsyas, Agrippa's freeman, when he brought the news of his death to his master; and Ahasuerus by Esther; and Nero himself is called a civil beast by Apollonius Tyanaeus; though some think that not Nero, but Helius, whom he had appointed governor in his room, he being at this time in Greece, is here meant, before whom Paul was tried, and out of whose hands he was delivered."</p>
