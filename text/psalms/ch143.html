  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Hear my prayer, O LORD. Give ear to my supplications.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Answer me in your faithfulness and in your righteousness.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; And do not enter into judgment with your servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in your sight no living man is righteous.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For the enemy has persecuted my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has smitten my life down to the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has made me to dwell in darkness as those who have been long dead.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Therefore, my spirit is overwhelmed within me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart within me is desolate.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; I remember the days of old.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I meditate on all your works.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I muse on the work of your hands.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I stretch forth my hands to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My soul thirsts after you as a thirsty land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Hear me speedily, O LORD. My spirit fails.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not hide your face from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest I be like those who go down into the pit.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Cause me to hear your loving-kindness in the morning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I trust in you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I lift up my soul to you.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I flee to you to hide me.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Teach me to do your will,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your Spirit is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Revive me, O LORD, for your name's sake.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And in your mercy cut off my enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy all those who afflict my soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am your servant.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Although the enemies with whom David had to contend were wicked, and their persecution as unjust as it was cruel, David recognized the just judgment of God in it all, and seeks to conciliate his favor by humbly supplicating pardon. Having complained of the cruelty of his enemies, and declared that amidst all his affliction he still remembered God, he prays for restoration, and the guidance of God's Spirit, that the remainder of his life might be devoted to his fear.</p>
