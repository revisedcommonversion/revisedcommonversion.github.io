  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] Hear my prayer, O LORD. Give ear to my supplications. Answer me in your faithfulness and in your righteousness.</p>

  <p>2 And do not enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight no living man is righteous.</p>

  <p>3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul. He has smitten my life down to the ground. He has made me to dwell in darkness as those who have been long dead.</p>

  <p>4 Therefore, my spirit is overwhelmed within me. My heart within me is desolate.</p>

  <p>5 I remember the days of old. I meditate on all your works. I muse on the work of your hands.</p>

  <p>6 I stretch forth my hands to you. My soul thirsts after you as a thirsty land. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>7 Hear me speedily, O LORD. My spirit fails. Do not hide your face from me, lest I be like those who go down into the pit.</p>

  <p>8 Cause me to hear your loving-kindness in the morning, for I trust in you. Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul to you.</p>

  <p>9 Deliver me, O LORD, from my enemies. I flee to you to hide me.</p>

  <p>10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your Spirit is good. Lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>

  <p>11 Revive me, O LORD, for your name's sake. For your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>

  <p>12 And in your mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Although the enemies with whom David had to contend were wicked, and their persecution as unjust as it was cruel, David recognized the just judgment of God in it all, and seeks to conciliate his favor by humbly supplicating pardon. Having complained of the cruelty of his enemies, and declared that amidst all his affliction he still remembered God, he prays for restoration, and the guidance of God's Spirit, that the remainder of his life might be devoted to his fear.</p>
