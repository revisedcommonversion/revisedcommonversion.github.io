  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am weak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD, heal me, for my bones are agitated.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> My soul is also greatly disquieted.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you, O LORD, how long?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Oh save me for your mercy's sake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For in death there is no remembrance of you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the grave, who will give you thanks?</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20006.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 6</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, being afflicted by the hand of God, acknowledges that he had provoked the Divine wrath by his sins, and, therefore, in order to obtain relief, he prays for forgiveness. At the same time, he regrets, that by being taken out of the world, he would be deprived of an opportunity of praising God. Then, having obtained confidence, he celebrates the grace of God, and directs his discourse to his enemies, who triumphed over his calamities.</p>
  <p>[v.3] - Quoted in John 12:27.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoted in Matthew 7:23; Luke 13:27.</p>
  <p>[v.8-10] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "The confidence and security which David takes to himself from the favor of God ought also to be noticed. From this, we are taught that there is nothing in the whole world, whatever it may be, and whatever opposition it may make to us, which we may not despise, if we are fully persuaded of our being beloved by God; and by this also we understand what his fatherly love can do for us... When God suddenly changes men's afflicted condition into one of joy and happiness, he thereby manifests more illustriously his power, and makes it appear the more wonderful."</p>
