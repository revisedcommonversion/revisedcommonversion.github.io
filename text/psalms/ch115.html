    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Not to us, O LORD, not to us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to your name give glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your mercy and for your truth's sake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Why should the heathen say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Where now is their God?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> But our God is in the heavens.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has done whatever he pleased.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Their idols are silver and gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of men's hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They have mouths, but they do not speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have eyes, but they do not see.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> They have ears, but they do not hear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have noses, but they do not smell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They have hands, but they do not handle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have feet, but they do not walk.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not speak through their throat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Those who make them are like them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so is everyone who trusts in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> O Israel, trust in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is their help and their shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is their help and their shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is their help and their shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The LORD has been mindful of us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will bless us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will bless the house of Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will bless the house of Aaron.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He will bless those who fear the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both small and great.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The LORD will increase you more and more—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you and your children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> You are blessed of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who made heaven and earth.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20115.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 115</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>It is obvious that this psalm was penned when the Church was deeply afflicted. Unworthy as they are to be heard by God, the faithful, nevertheless, offer up supplications to him for deliverance, lest his holy name might be exposed to scorn and reproach among the heathen. Then, mustering courage, they mock at the madness of all who are addicted to the worship of idols; and, with holy boasting, they magnify their own happiness, in that they have been adopted by God; and from this also they take occasion to stimulate one another to acknowledge the kindness which they have received from him.</p>
