  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory for your mercy and for your truth's sake.</p>

  <p>2 Why should the heathen say, "Where now is their God?"</p>

  <p>3 But our God is in the heavens. He has done whatever he pleased.</p>

  <p>4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>

  <p>5 They have mouths, but they do not speak. They have eyes, but they do not see.</p>

  <p>6 They have ears, but they do not hear. They have noses, but they do not smell.</p>

  <p>7 They have hands, but they do not handle. They have feet, but they do not walk. They do not speak through their throat.</p>

  <p>8 Those who make them are like them, and so is everyone who trusts in them.</p>

  <p>9 O Israel, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>11 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>12 The LORD has been mindful of us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.</p>

  <p>13 He will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great.</p>

  <p>14 The LORD will increase you more and moreâ€”you and your children.</p>

  <p>15 You are blessed of the LORD who made heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S, but the earth he has given to the children of men.</p>

  <p>17 The dead do not praise the LORD, neither any who go down into silence.</p>

  <p>18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forever. Praise the LORD.</p>
