  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory for your mercy and for your truth's sake.</p>

  <p>2 Why should the heathen say, "Where now is their God?"</p>

  <p>3 But our God is in the heavens. He has done whatever he pleased.</p>

  <p>4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>

  <p>5 They have mouths, but they do not speak. They have eyes, but they do not see.</p>

  <p>6 They have ears, but they do not hear. They have noses, but they do not smell.</p>

  <p>7 They have hands, but they do not handle. They have feet, but they do not walk. They do not speak through their throat.</p>

  <p>8 Those who make them are like them, and so is everyone who trusts in them.</p>

  <p>9 O Israel, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>11 You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD. He is their help and their shield.</p>

  <p>12 The LORD has been mindful of us. He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel. He will bless the house of Aaron.</p>

  <p>13 He will bless those who fear the LORD, both small and great.</p>

  <p>14 The LORD will increase you more and more—you and your children.</p>

  <p>15 You are blessed of the LORD who made heaven and earth.</p>

  <p>16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S, but the earth he has given to the children of men.</p>

  <p>17 The dead do not praise the LORD, neither any who go down into silence.</p>

  <p>18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forever. Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20115.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 115</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>It is obvious that this psalm was penned when the Church was deeply afflicted. Unworthy as they are to be heard by God, the faithful, nevertheless, offer up supplications to him for deliverance, lest his holy name might be exposed to scorn and reproach among the heathen. Then, mustering courage, they mock at the madness of all who are addicted to the worship of idols; and, with holy boasting, they magnify their own happiness, in that they have been adopted by God; and from this also they take occasion to stimulate one another to acknowledge the kindness which they have received from him.</p>
