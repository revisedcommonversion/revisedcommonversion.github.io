  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] O LORD, you have searched me and known me.</p>

  <p>2 You know my sitting down and my rising up. You understand my thought afar off.</p>

  <p>3 You compass my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways.</p>

  <p>4 For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.</p>

  <p>5 You have beset me behind and before and laid your hand upon me.</p>

  <p>6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. It is high. I cannot attain to it.</p>

  <p>7 Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence?</p>

  <p>8 If I ascend into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.</p>

  <p>9 If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</p>

  <p>10 Even there your hand shall lead me and your right hand shall hold me.</p>

  <p>11 If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me,"</p>

  <p>12 Even the darkness does not hide from you, but the night shines as the day. The darkness and the light are both alike to you.</p>

  <p>13 For you have possessed my inmost being. You have covered me in my mother's womb.</p>

  <p>14 I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, and that my soul knows well.</p>

  <p>15 My substance was not hid from you when I was made in secret and skillfully formed in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>

  <p>16 Your eyes saw my substance, yet being imperfect. And in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them.</p>

  <p>17 How precious your thoughts are to me, O God! How great the sum of them is!</p>

  <p>18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. When I awake, I am still with you.</p>

  <p>19 Surely you will slay the wicked, O God. Depart from me therefore, you bloody men.</p>

  <p>20 For they speak against you wickedly, and your enemies take your name in vain.</p>

  <p>21 Do I, O LORD, not hate those who hate you? And am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?</p>

  <p>22 I hate them with perfect hatred. I count them my enemies.</p>

  <p>23 Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts.</p>

  <p>24 See if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the everlasting way.</p>
