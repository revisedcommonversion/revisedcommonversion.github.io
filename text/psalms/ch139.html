  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">O LORD, you have searched me and known me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> You know my sitting down and my rising up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You understand my thought afar off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You compass my path and my lying down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are acquainted with all my ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For there is not a word on my tongue,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but behold, O LORD, you know it altogether.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You have beset me behind and before<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and laid your hand upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is high. I cannot attain to it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Where shall I go from your Spirit?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or where shall I flee from your presence?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> If I ascend into heaven, you are there.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> If I take the wings of the morning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Even there your hand shall lead me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your right hand shall hold me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the night shall be light around me,"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Even the darkness does not hide from you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the night shines like the day.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The darkness and the light are both alike to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For you have possessed my inmost being.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have covered me in my mother's womb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I will praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your works are wonderful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that my soul knows well.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My substance was not hid from you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I was made in secret<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and skillfully formed in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Your eyes saw my substance, being without form.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And in your book they were all written,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the days that were ordained for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when as yet there were none of them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> How precious your thoughts are to me, O God!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How great the sum of them is!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> If I should count them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are more in number than the sand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I awake, I am still with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Surely you will slay the wicked, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Depart from me therefore, you bloody men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> For they speak against you wickedly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your enemies take your name in vain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Do I, O LORD, not hate those who hate you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> I hate them with perfect hatred.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I count them my enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Search me, O God, and know my heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Try me and know my thoughts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> See if there is any wicked way in me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lead me in the everlasting way.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20139.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 139</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this Psalm David, that he may dismiss the deceptive coverings under which most men take refuge, and divest himself of hypocrisy, insists at large upon the truth that nothing can elude the divine observation&mdash; a truth which he illustrates from the original formation of man, since he who fashioned us in our mother's womb, and imparted to every member its particular office and function, cannot possibly be ignorant of our actions. Quickened by this meditation to a due reverential fear of God, he declares himself to have no sympathy with the ungodly and profane, and beseeches God, in the confidence of conscious integrity, not to forsake him in this life.</p>
