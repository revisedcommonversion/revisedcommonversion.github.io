    <h3>Psalm 73</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">The prophet, prevailing in a temptation, 1, shows the occasion thereof, the prosperity of the wicked, 2-12; the wound given thereby, diffidence, 13, 14; the victory over it, and knowledge of God's purpose in destroying the wicked and sustaining the righteous, 15-28.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of Asaph.</span>] Truly God is good to Israel, even to those who are of a clean heart.</p>

  <p>2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone. My steps had well near slipped.</p>

  <p>3 For I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>

  <p>4 For there are no pangs in their death, but their strength is firm.</p>

  <p>5 They are not in trouble as other men, neither are they afflicted like other men.</p>

  <p>6 Therefore, pride encompasses them as a chain. Violence covers them as a garment.</p>

  <p>7 Their eyes stand out with fatness. The imaginations of their heart transgressed.</p>

  <p>8 They are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression. They speak loftily.</p>

  <p>9 They set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walks through the earth.</p>

  <p>10 Therefore, his people return here. And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</p>

  <p>11 And they say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?"</p>

  <p>12 Behold, these are the ungodly who prosper in the world. They increase in riches.</p>

  <p>13 Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocence.</p>

  <p>14 For all the day long I have been afflicted and chastened every morning.</p>

  <p>15 If I say, "I will speak thus," behold, I should offend against the generation of your children.</p>

  <p>16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me,</p>

  <p>17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God. Then I understood their end.</p>

  <p>18 Surely you set them in slippery places. You cast them down into destruction.</p>

  <p>19 How they are brought into desolation as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>

  <p>20 As a dream when one awakes, so, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their image.</p>

  <p>21 Thus my soul was grieved and I was pricked in my heart.</p>

  <p>22 So foolish was I, and ignorant. I was as a beast before you.</p>

  <p>23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you. You have held me by my right hand.</p>

  <p>24 You will guide me with your counsel and afterward receive me to glory.</p>

  <p>25 Who do I have in heaven but you? And there is no one upon earth that I desire besides you.</p>

  <p>26 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>

  <p>27 For behold, those who are far from you shall perish. You have destroyed all those who go astray from you.</p>

  <p>28 But it is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in the Lord GOD so that I may declare all your works.</p>
