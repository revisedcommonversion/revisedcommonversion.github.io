  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Truly God is good to Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to those who are of a clean heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My steps had well near slipped.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For I was envious at the foolish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For there are no pangs in their death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but their strength is firm.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They are not in trouble as other men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither are they afflicted like other men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, pride encompasses them as a chain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Violence covers them as a garment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Their eyes stand out with fatness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The imaginations of their heart transgressed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They speak loftily.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They set their mouth against the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their tongue walks through the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Therefore, his people return here.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And they say, "How does God know?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And is there knowledge in the Most High?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Behold, these are the ungodly<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who prosper in the world. They increase in riches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Truly I have cleansed my heart in vain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and washed my hands in innocence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> For all the day long I have been afflicted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chastened every morning.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> If I say, "I will speak thus,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behold, I should offend against the generation of your children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> When I thought to know this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it was too painful for me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Until I went into the sanctuary of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then I understood their end.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Surely you set them in slippery places.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You cast them down into destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> How they are brought into desolation as in a moment!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> As a dream when one awakes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their image.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Thus my soul was grieved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was pricked in my heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> So foolish was I, and ignorant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was as a beast before you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Nevertheless, I am continually with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have held me by my right hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> You will guide me with your counsel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and afterward receive me to glory.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Whom do I have in heaven but you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there is no one upon earth that I desire besides you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> My flesh and my heart fails,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> For behold, those who are far from you shall perish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have destroyed all those who go astray from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> But it is good for me to draw near to God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have put my trust in the Lord GOD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may declare all your works.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20073.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 73</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, or whoever may have been the author of this psalm, contending as it were against the judgment of carnal sense and reason, begins by extolling the righteousness and goodness of God. He next confesses that when he saw the wicked abounding in wealth, and living in the indulgence of every kind of pleasure, yea, even scornfully mocking God, and cruelly harassing the righteous, and that when he saw, on the other hand, how in proportion to the care with which any studied to practice uprightness, was the degree in which they were weighed down by troubles and calamities, and that in general all the children of God were pining away, and oppressed with cares and sorrows, while God, as if sitting in heaven idle and unconcerned, did not interfere to remedy such a disordered state of matters; it gave him so severe a shock, as almost to dispose him to cast off all concern about religion and all fear of God. In the third place, he reproves his own folly in proceeding rashly and hastily to pronounce judgment, merely from a view of the present state of things, and shows the necessity of exercising patience, that our faith may not fail under these troubles and disquietudes. At last he concludes that, provided we leave the providence of God to take its own course, in the way which he has determined in his secret purpose, in the end, matters will assume a very different aspect, and it will be seen, that, on the one hand, the righteous are not defrauded of their reward, and that, on the other, the wicked do not escape the hand of the judge.</p>
