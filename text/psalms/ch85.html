  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah.</span>] LORD, you have been favorable to your land. You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>

  <p>2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people. You have covered all their sin. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>3 You have taken away all your wrath. You have turned yourself from the fierceness of your anger.</p>

  <p>4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause your anger toward us to cease.</p>

  <p>5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you draw out your anger to all generations?</p>

  <p>6 Will you not revive us again so that your people may rejoice in you?</p>

  <p>7 Show us your mercy, O LORD, and grant us your salvation.</p>

  <p>8 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak peace to his people and to his saints. But do not let them turn back to folly.</p>

  <p>9 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him so that glory may dwell in our land.</p>

  <p>10 Mercy and truth are met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p>

  <p>11 Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>

  <p>12 Indeed, the LORD will give that which is good, and our land shall yield her increase.</p>

  <p>13 Righteousness shall go before him and set us in the way of his steps.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20085.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 85</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>God having afflicted his people with new troubles and calamities, after their return from their captivity in Babylon, they, in the first place, make mention of their deliverance as an argument why he should not leave unfinished the work of his grace. Then they complain of the long continuance of their afflictions. And, in the third place, inspired with hope and confidence, they triumph in the blessedness promised them; for their restoration to their own country was connected with the kingdom of Christ, from which they anticipated an abundance of all good things.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Reference, Habakkuk 2:1.</p>
