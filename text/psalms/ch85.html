  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">LORD, you have been favorable to your land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have covered all their sin.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You have taken away all your wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have turned yourself from the fierceness of your anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Turn us, O God of our salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cause your anger toward us to cease.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Will you be angry with us forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you draw out your anger to all generations?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Will you not revive us again<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that your people may rejoice in you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Show us your mercy, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and grant us your salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he will speak peace to his people and to his saints.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But do not let them turn back to folly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Surely his salvation is near those who fear him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that glory may dwell in our land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Mercy and truth are met together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Truth shall spring out of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Indeed, the LORD will give that which is good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our land shall yield her increase.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Righteousness shall go before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set us in the way of his steps.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20085.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 85</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>God having afflicted his people with new troubles and calamities, after their return from their captivity in Babylon, they, in the first place, make mention of their deliverance as an argument why he should not leave unfinished the work of his grace. Then they complain of the long continuance of their afflictions. And, in the third place, inspired with hope and confidence, they triumph in the blessedness promised them; for their restoration to their own country was connected with the kingdom of Christ, from which they anticipated an abundance of all good things.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Reference, Habakkuk 2:1.</p>
