    <p class="in-verse">Praise waits for you, O God, in Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And to you the vow shall be performed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> O you who hear prayer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to you all flesh shall come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Iniquities prevail against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As for our transgressions, you shall purge them away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Blessed is the man whom you choose and cause to approach you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may dwell in your courts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even of your holy temple.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> By terrible things in righteousness you will answer us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O God of our salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are the confidence of all the ends of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of those who are afar off upon the sea,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Who by his strength firmly sets the mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />being girded with power,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Who stills the noise of the seas,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the noise of their waves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the tumult of the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Also those who dwell in the uttermost parts are in awe of your signs.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You water its ridges abundantly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You settle its furrows.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You make it soft with showers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You bless its springing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> You crown the year with your goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your paths drop fatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The pastures are clothed with flocks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The valleys are also covered over with grain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shout for joy. They also sing.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20065.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 65</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm is composed both of petition and thanksgiving. It contains a prediction of the Gentiles being called to the common faith, but is principally occupied with praising God for the fatherly care which he exercises over his Church, and the benefits which flow from it. The Psalmist prays particularly that God would continue his former kindness to the Jewish people. Two instances of the Divine goodness are specified,&mdash; the powerful defense extended to their land, and the enriching of it with so many blessings.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "Who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves" - Reference, Matthew 8:26; Mark 4:39-41; Luke 8:23-25.</p>
