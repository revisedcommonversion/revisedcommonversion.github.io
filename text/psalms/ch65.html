  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm and Song of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Praise waits for you, O God, in Zion. <br />And to you the vow shall be performed.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; O you who hear prayer, <br />to you all flesh shall come.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Iniquities prevail against me. <br />As for our transgressions, you shall purge them away.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Blessed is the man whom you choose and cause to approach you <br />so that he may dwell in your courts. <br />We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, <br />even of your holy temple.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; By terrible things in righteousness you will answer us, O God of our salvation. <br />You are the confidence of all the ends of the earth <br />and of those who are afar off upon the sea,</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Who by his strength firmly sets the mountains, <br />being girded with power,</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Who stills the noise of the seas, <br />the noise of their waves, <br />and the tumult of the people.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Also those who dwell in the uttermost parts are in awe of your signs. <br />You make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; You visit the earth and water it. <br />You greatly enrich it with the river of God, <br />which is full of water. <br />You prepare their grain when you have thus provided for it.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;You water its ridges abundantly. <br />You settle its furrows. <br />You make it soft with showers. <br />You bless its springing.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;You crown the year with your goodness <br />and your paths drop fatness.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness, <br />and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;The pastures are clothed with flocks. <br />The valleys are also covered over with grain. <br />They shout for joy. They also sing.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20065.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 65</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm is composed both of petition and thanksgiving. It contains a prediction of the Gentiles being called to the common faith, but is principally occupied with praising God for the fatherly care which he exercises over his Church, and the benefits which flow from it. The Psalmist prays particularly that God would continue his former kindness to the Jewish people. Two instances of the Divine goodness are specified,&mdash; the powerful defense extended to their land, and the enriching of it with so many blessings.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "Who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves" - Reference, Matthew 8:26; Mark 4:39-41; Luke 8:23-25.</p>
