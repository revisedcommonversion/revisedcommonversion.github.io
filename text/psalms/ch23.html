  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] The LORD is my shepherd. I shall lack nothing.</p>

  <p>2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside the still waters.</p>

  <p>3 He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</p>

  <p>4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.</p>

  <p>5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over.</p>

  <p>6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20023.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 23</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm is neither intermingled with prayers, nor does it complain of miseries for the purpose of obtaining relief; but it contains simply a thanksgiving, from which it appears that it was composed when David had obtained peaceable possession of the kingdom, and lived in prosperity, and in the enjoyment of all he could desire. That he might not, therefore, in the time of his great prosperity, be like worldly men, who, when they seem to themselves to be fortunate, bury God in forgetfulness, and luxuriously plunge themselves into their pleasures, he delights himself in God, the author of all the blessings which he enjoyed. And he not only acknowledges that the state of tranquillity in which he now lives, and his exemption from all inconveniences and troubles, is owing to the goodness of God; but he also trusts that through his providence he will continue happy even to the close of his life, and for this end that he may employ himself in his pure worship.</p>
