  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Do not hold your peace, O God of my praise,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are opened against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have spoken against me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with a lying tongue.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They encompassed me also with words of hatred<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fought against me without a cause.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For my love they are my adversaries,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I give myself to prayer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And they have rewarded me evil for good<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hatred for my love.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Set a wicked man over him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> When he is judged, let him be condemned<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let his prayer become sin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Let his days be few<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let another take his office.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Let his children be fatherless<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his wife a widow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Let his children continually wander around and beg.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them also seek their bread out of their desolate places.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Let the extortioner catch all that he has,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let strangers plunder his labor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Let there be no one to extend mercy to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Let his posterity be cut off,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Let them be before the LORD continually<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may cut off their memory from the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For he did not remember to show mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but persecuted the poor and needy man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> As he loved cursing, so let it come to him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so let it come into his body like water<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like oil into his bones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Let it be to him as the garment which covers him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for a girdle with which he is girded continually.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of those who speak evil against my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> But deal with me, O GOD the Lord, for your name's sake.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because your mercy is good, deliver me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For I am poor and needy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my heart is wounded within me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> I am gone like the shadow when it declines.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> My knees are weak through fasting,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my flesh fails of fatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I also became a reproach to them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When they looked upon me, they shook their heads.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Help me, O LORD my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O save me according to your mercy,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> So that they may know that this is your hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you, LORD, have done it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> They may curse, but you bless.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When they arise, let them be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but let your servant rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Let my adversaries be clothed with shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let them cover themselves with their own shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as with a mantle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will even praise him among the multitude.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> For he will stand at the right hand of the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to save him from those who condemn his soul.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20109.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 109</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm consists of three parts. It begins with a complaint; next follows an enumeration of various imprecations; and then comes a prayer with an expression of true gratitude. And although David here complains of the injuries which he sustained, yet, as he was a typical character, everything that is expressed in the psalm must properly be applied to Christ, the Head of the Church, and to all the faithful, inasmuch as they are his members; so that when unjustly treated and tormented by their enemies, they may apply to God for help, to whom vengeance belongs.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoted in Acts 1:20.</p>
