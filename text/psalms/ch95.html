  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O come, let us sing to the LORD. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</p>

  <p>2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.</p>

  <p>3 For the LORD is a great God and a great King above all gods.</p>

  <p>4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth. The strength of the hills is his also.</p>

  <p>5 The sea is his, and he made it. And his hands formed the dry land.</p>

  <p>6 O come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</p>

  <p>7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you will hear his voice,</p>

  <p>8 Do not harden your heart, as at Meribah, and as in the day of Massah in the wilderness,</p>

  <p>9 "When your fathers tested me, they proved me and saw my work.</p>

  <p>10 Forty long years I was grieved with this generation and said, 'It is a people who err in their heart, and they have not known my ways,'</p>

  <p>11 To whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest."</p>
