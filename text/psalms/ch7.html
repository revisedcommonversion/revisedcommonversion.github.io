  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">Shiggaion of David: which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite.</span>] O LORD my God, I put my trust in you. Save me from all those who persecute me, and deliver me,</p>

  <p>2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.</p>

  <p>3 O LORD my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands,</p>

  <p>4 If I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (I have even delivered him who without cause is my enemy),</p>

  <p>5 Let the enemy persecute my soul and take it. Let him even tread down my life upon the earth and lay my honor in the dust. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>6 Arise, O LORD, in your anger, lift up yourself because of the rage of my enemies, and awake for me to the judgment that you have commanded.</p>

  <p>7 And the congregation of the people shall encompass you. For their sakes therefore return on high.</p>

  <p>8 The LORD shall judge the people. Judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity that is in me.</p>

  <p>9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just, for the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.</p>

  <p>10 My defense is from God, who saves the upright in heart.</p>

  <p>11 God judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>

  <p>12 If he does not turn, he will whet his sword. He has bent his bow and made it ready.</p>

  <p>13 He has also prepared for him the instruments of death. He ordains his arrows against the persecutors.</p>

  <p>14 Behold, he travails with iniquity, has conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>

  <p>15 He made a pit, dug it, and has fallen into the ditch which he made.</p>

  <p>16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>

  <p>17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p>
