  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have defiled your holy temple.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there was no one to bury them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> We have become a reproach to our neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a scorn and derision to those who are around us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> How long, LORD? Will you be angry forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall your jealousy burn like fire?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who have not known you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For they have devoured Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and laid waste his dwelling-place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> O do not hold former iniquities against us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let your tender mercies speedily meet us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for we are brought very low.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and deliver us and purge away our sins for your name's sake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Why should the heathen say, "Where is their God?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let him be known among the heathen in our sight<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by avenging the blood of your servants which is shed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to the greatness of your power preserve those who are appointed to die.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> So we your people and sheep of your pasture<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will give you thanks forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will show forth your praise to all generations.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This is a complaint and lamentation of the Church when severely afflicted; in which, while the faithful bewail their miserable and, in one sense, undeserved calamities, and accuse their enemies of cruelty, they acknowledge that, in another sense, they have been justly chastised, and humbly betake themselves to the divine mercy. Their confidence of obtaining this, they rest chiefly upon the fact, that they saw God's dishonor conjoined with their calamities, inasmuch as the ungodly, in oppressing the Church, blasphemed his sacred name.</p>
