    <p class="in-verse">God is our refuge and strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a very present help in trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Therefore, we will not fear though the earth is changed, though the mountains are carried into the midst of the sea,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Though its waters roar and are disturbed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though the mountains shake with its swelling.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> There is a river, the streams of which shall make the city of God glad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />God shall help her at the turning of dawn.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The heathen raged. The kingdoms were moved.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He uttered his voice, and the earth melted.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20046.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 46</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm seems to be an expression of thanksgiving rather for some particular deliverance, than for the constant aid by which God has always protected and preserved his Church. It may be inferred from it that the city of Jerusalem. when stricken with great terror, and placed in extreme danger, was preserved, contrary to all expectation, by the unlooked for and miraculous power of God. The prophet, therefore, whoever composed the psalm, commending a deliverance so singularly vouchsafed by God, exhorts the faithful to commit themselves confidently to his protection, and not to doubt that, relying fearlessly upon him as their guardian and the protector of their welfare, they shall be continually preserved in safety from all the assaults of their enemies, because it is his peculiar office to quell all commotions.</p>
