  <p>1 [<span class="it">Michtam of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Preserve me, O God, for I put my trust in you.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; O my soul, you have said to the LORD, "You are my Lord.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My goodness does not extend to you."</p>

    <p>3&emsp; But to the saints who are in the earth, and to the excellent,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all my delight is in them.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their drink-offerings of blood I will not offer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor take their names into my lips.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You maintain my lot.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, I have a beautiful heritage.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; I will bless the LORD who has given me counsel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart also instructs me in the night season.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; I have set the LORD always before me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoices.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My flesh shall also rest in hope.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For you will not leave my soul in hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will you allow your Holy One to see corruption.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;You will show me the path of life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In your presence is fullness of joy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20016.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 16</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In the beginning David commends himself to the protection of God. He then meditates upon the benefits which he received from God, and thereby stirs himself up to thanksgiving. By his service, it is true, he could in no respect be profitable to God, but he, notwithstanding, surrenders and devotes himself entirely to him, protesting that he will have nothing to do with superstitions. He also states the reason of this to be, that full and substantial happiness consists in resting in God alone, who never suffers his own people to want any good thing.</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "My goodness does not extend to you" - LXX: "or you have no need of my goodness."</p>
  <p>[v.8-11] - Quoted in Acts 2:25-28.</p>
  <p>[v.10a] - Quoted in Acts 13:36.</p>
  <p>[v.10b] - Reference, Isaiah 26:19; Hosea 6:2; 1st Corinthians 15:4.</p>
