  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Jonathelem-rechokim. Michtam of David: when the Philistines took him in Gath.</span>] Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up. Fighting daily he oppresses me.</p>

  <p>2 My enemies would swallow me up daily, for they are many who fight against me, O Most High.</p>

  <p>3 In the time when I am afraid, I will trust in you.</p>

  <p>4 In God (I will praise his word), in God I have put my trust. I will not fear what flesh can do to me.</p>

  <p>5 Every day they wrest my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil.</p>

  <p>6 They assemble themselves, they hide themselves, they mark my steps when they wait for my soul.</p>

  <p>7 Shall they escape by iniquity? In your anger cast down the people, O God.</p>

  <p>8 You number my wanderings. Put my tears into your bottle. Are they not in your book?</p>

  <p>9 When I cry to you, my enemies shall turn back. I know this, for God is for me.</p>

  <p>10 In God (I will praise his word), in the LORD (I will praise his word),</p>

  <p>11 In God I have put my trust. I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.</p>

  <p>12 Your vows are upon me, O God. I will render praises to you.</p>

  <p>13 For you have delivered my soul from death. Will you not deliver my feet from falling so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</p>
