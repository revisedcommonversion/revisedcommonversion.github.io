  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Bow down your ear, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Hear me, for I am poor and needy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Preserve my soul, for I am holy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O you, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Be merciful to me, O Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I cry to you daily.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Bring joy to the soul of your servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and abundant in mercy to all those who call upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> In the day of my trouble I will call upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you will answer me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Among the gods there is no one like you, O Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither are there any works like your works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> All nations whom you have made<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall come and worship before you, O Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall glorify your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For you are great and do wondrous things.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are God alone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Teach me your way, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will walk in your truth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Unite my heart to fear your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will glorify your name forevermore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For your mercy is great toward me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> O God, the proud have risen against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have not set you before them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> But you, O Lord, are a God full of compassion and gracious.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are patient and abundant in mercy and truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> O turn to me and have mercy upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give your strength to your servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and save the son of your woman-servant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Show me a token for good<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20086.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 86</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm prayers and holy meditations, engaged in with the view of nourishing and confirming faith, together with praises and thanksgivings, are intermingled. It having been difficult in the judgement of carnal reason for David to escape from the distresses with which he was environed, he sets in opposition to its conclusions the infinite goodness and power of God. Nor does he simply request deliverance from his enemies; but he also prays that the fear of God may be implanted and firmly established in heart.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in Revelation 15:4.</p>
