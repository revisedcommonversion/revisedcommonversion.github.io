  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of David.</span>] Bow down your ear, O LORD. Hear me, for I am poor and needy.</p>

  <p>2 Preserve my soul, for I am holy. O you, my God, save your servant who trusts in you.</p>

  <p>3 Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I cry to you daily.</p>

  <p>4 Rejoice the soul of your servant. For to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</p>

  <p>5 For you, Lord, are good and ready to forgive and abundant in mercy to all those who call upon you.</p>

  <p>6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>

  <p>7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon you, for you will answer me.</p>

  <p>8 Among the gods there is no one like you, O Lord, neither are there any works like your works.</p>

  <p>9 All nations whom you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name.</p>

  <p>10 For you are great and do wondrous things. You are God alone.</p>

  <p>11 Teach me your way, O LORD. I will walk in your truth. Unite my heart to fear your name.</p>

  <p>12 I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart and I will glorify your name forevermore.</p>

  <p>13 For your mercy is great toward me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</p>

  <p>14 O God, the proud have risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul. They have not set you before them.</p>

  <p>15 But you, O Lord, are a God full of compassion and gracious. You are patient and abundant in mercy and truth.</p>

  <p>16 O turn to me and have mercy upon me. Give your strength to your servant and save the son of your handmaid.</p>

  <p>17 Show me a token for good so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</p>
