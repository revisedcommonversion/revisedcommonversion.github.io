  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of the Afflicted: when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the LORD.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Hear my prayer, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let my cry come to you.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Do not hide your face from me in the day when I am in trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incline your ear to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the day when I call, answer me speedily.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For my days are consumed like smoke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my bones are burned as a hearth.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; My heart is smitten and withered like grass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; By reason of the voice of my groaning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my bones cleave to my skin.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I am like a pelican of the wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am like an owl of the desert.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; I watch and am as a sparrow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />alone upon the housetop.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; My enemies reproach me all the day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are enraged against me have sworn against me.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; For I have eaten ashes like bread<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and mingled my drink with weeping,</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Because of your indignation and your wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For you have lifted me up and cast me down.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;My days are like a shadow that declines,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I am withered like grass.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;But you, O LORD, shall endure forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your remembrance to all generations.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the time to favor her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the set time, has come.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;For your servants take pleasure in her stones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and favor the dust thereof.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the kings of the earth your glory.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;When the LORD builds up Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will appear in his glory.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;He will regard the prayer of the destitute<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not despise their prayer.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;This shall be written for the generation to come.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From heaven the LORD has beheld the earth,</p>

    <p>20&emsp;To hear the groaning of the prisoner,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to release those who are appointed to death,</p>

    <p>21&emsp;To declare the name of the LORD in Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his praise in Jerusalem,</p>

    <p>22&emsp;When the people are assembled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;He weakened my strength in the way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shortened my days.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;I said, "O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your years are throughout all generations.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Of old you have laid the foundation of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;They shall perish, but you will endure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, all of them shall grow old like a garment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As a vesture you will change them, and they shall be changed.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;But you are the same,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your years will have no end.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;The children of your servants shall continue,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their offspring shall be established before you."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20102.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 102</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This prayer seems to have been dictated to the faithful when they were languishing in captivity in Babylon. Sorrowful and humbled, they first bewail their afflictions. In the next place, they plead with God for the restoration of the holy city and temple. To encourage themselves to come before him in prayer with the greater confidence, they call to remembrance the Divine promises in reference to the happy renovation both of the kingdom and of the priesthood; and they not only assure themselves of deliverance from captivity, but also beseech God to bring kings and nations in subjection to himself. In the close of the psalm, after having interposed a brief complaint concerning their distressing and afflicted condition, they draw consolation from the eternity of God; for, in adopting his servants to a better hope, he has separated them from the common lot of men.</p>
