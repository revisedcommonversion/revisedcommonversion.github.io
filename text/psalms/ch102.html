  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of the Afflicted: when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the LORD.</span>] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come to you.</p>

  <p>2 Do not hide your face from me in the day when I am in trouble. Incline your ear to me. In the day when I call, answer me speedily.</p>

  <p>3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.</p>

  <p>4 My heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>

  <p>5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin.</p>

  <p>6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness. I am like an owl of the desert.</p>

  <p>7 I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>

  <p>8 My enemies reproach me all the day, and those who are enraged against me have sworn against me.</p>

  <p>9 For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping,</p>

  <p>10 Because of your indignation and your wrath. For you have lifted me up and cast me down.</p>

  <p>11 My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.</p>

  <p>12 But you, O LORD, shall endure forever, and your remembrance to all generations.</p>

  <p>13 You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion, for the time to favor her, even the set time, has come.</p>

  <p>14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones and favor the dust thereof.</p>

  <p>15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth your glory.</p>

  <p>16 When the LORD builds up Zion, he will appear in his glory.</p>

  <p>17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer.</p>

  <p>18 This shall be written for the generation to come. And the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</p>

  <p>19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary. From heaven the LORD has beheld the earth,</p>

  <p>20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those who are appointed to death,</p>

  <p>21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem,</p>

  <p>22 When the people are assembled, and also the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>

  <p>23 He weakened my strength in the way. He shortened my days.</p>

  <p>24 I said, "O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days. Your years are throughout all generations.</p>

  <p>25 Of old you have laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>

  <p>26 They shall perish, but you will endure. Indeed, all of them shall grow old like a garment. As a vesture you will change them, and they shall be changed.</p>

  <p>27 But you are the same, and your years will have no end.</p>

  <p>28 The children of your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before you."</p>
