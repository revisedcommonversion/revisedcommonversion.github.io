  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Blessed be the LORD my strength<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who teaches my hands to war<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my fingers to fight;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> My goodness, my fortress,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my high tower, and my deliverer;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my shield, and he in whom I trust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who subdues my people under me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> LORD, what is man that you take knowledge of him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the son of man that you make account of him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Man is like vanity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His days are like a shadow that passes away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Cast forth lightning and scatter them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shoot your arrows and destroy them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Send your hand from above.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Rid me and deliver me from the great waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the hand of strange children,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Whose mouth speaks vanity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I will sing a new song to you, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praises to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> It is he who gives salvation to kings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who delivers David his servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the hurtful sword.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Rid me and deliver me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the hand of strange children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose mouth speaks vanity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> So that our sons may be like plants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />grown up in their youth;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that our daughters may be like corner stones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />polished after the similitude of a palace;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> So that our granaries may be full,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />affording all manner of store;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that our sheep may bring forth thousands<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and ten thousands in our streets;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> So that our oxen may be strong to labor;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that there is no breaking in nor going out;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so that there is no complaining in our streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Happy are the people who are in such a case.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, happy are the people whose God is the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20144.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 144</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This Psalm contains a mixture of praise trod prayer; for David, while he extols in very high terms the great mercies which God had bestowed upon him, is led at the same time, either from a consideration of the many trials to be met with in the whole course of human life, or from the connection he still had with wicked men, to pray that God would continue to show this favor to the end. There is this difference between it and Psalm 18, that the latter is triumphant throughout, the kingdom having been thoroughly subdued, and affairs going forward prosperously, whereas in the present he mixes up one or two things which are indicative of fear and anxiety, there being some remaining enemies to cause him apprehension.</p>
  <p>[v.3] - Reference, Job 7:17; Psalm 8:4.</p>
