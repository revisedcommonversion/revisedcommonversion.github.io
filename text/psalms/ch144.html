  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] Blessed be the LORD my strength who teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight;</p>

  <p>2 My goodness, my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust, who subdues my people under me.</p>

  <p>3 LORD, what is man that you take knowledge of him, or the son of man that you make account of him?</p>

  <p>4 Man is like vanity. His days are as a shadow that passes away.</p>

  <p>5 Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down. Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>

  <p>6 Cast forth lightning and scatter them. Shoot your arrows and destroy them.</p>

  <p>7 Send your hand from above. Rid me and deliver me from the great waters, from the hand of strange children,</p>

  <p>8 Whose mouth speaks vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>

  <p>9 I will sing a new song to you, O God. Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to you.</p>

  <p>10 It is he who gives salvation to kings, who delivers David his servant from the hurtful sword.</p>

  <p>11 Rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood,</p>

  <p>12 So that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; so that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace;</p>

  <p>13 So that our granaries may be full, affording all manner of store; so that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets;</p>

  <p>14 So that our oxen may be strong to labor; so that there is no breaking in, nor going out; and so that there is no complaining in our streets.</p>

  <p>15 Happy are the people who are in such a case. Indeed, happy are the people whose God is the LORD.</p>
