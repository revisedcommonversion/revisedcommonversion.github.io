  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."</p>

  <p>2 The LORD will send the rod of your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies.</p>

  <p>3 Your people shall be willing in the day of your power, in the beauties of holiness. From the womb of the morning, you have the dew of your youth.</p>

  <p>4 The LORD has sworn and will not repent, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."</p>

  <p>5 The Lord at your right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>

  <p>6 He will judge among the heathen. He will fill the places with the dead bodies. He will wound the heads over many countries.</p>

  <p>7 He will drink of the brook in the way. Therefore, he will lift up the head.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm David sets forth the perpetuity of Christ's reign, and the eternity of his priesthood; and, in the first place, he affirms, That God conferred upon Christ supreme dominion, combined with invincible power, with which he either conquers all his enemies, or compels them to submit to him. In the second place, he adds, That God would extend the boundaries of this kingdom far and wide; and, in the third place, That Christ, having been installed into the priestly office with all the solemnity of an oath, sustains the honors of that equally with those of his regal office. Finally, That this shall be a new order of priesthood, whose introduction shall put an end to the Levitical priesthood, which was temporary, and that it shall be everlasting.</p>
  <p>[v.1a] - The Greek text in the Septuagint includes the phrase, "for your feet," at the end of this verse, rendering it, "until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet." This is also included in the Greek text of the verses that reference this verse in the New Testament.</p>
  <p>[v.1b] - Quoted in Matthew 22:44, 26:64; Mark 12:36, 14:62; Luke 20:42-43, 22:69; Acts 2:34-35; Hebrews 1:13, 10:12-13.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Quoted in Hebrews 5:6; 6:20, 7:17, 21. Reference, Genesis 14:18-20.</p>
