  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.</span>] I will praise you, O LORD, with my whole heart. I will show forth all your wonderful works.</p>

  <p>2 I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O most High.</p>

  <p>3 When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at your presence.</p>

  <p>4 For you have maintained my right and my cause. You sat on the throne judging right.</p>

  <p>5 You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked, you have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p>

  <p>6 O enemy, destructions have come to a perpetual end, and you have destroyed cities. Their memorial has perished with them.</p>

  <p>7 But the LORD shall endure forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.</p>

  <p>8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness. He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>

  <p>9 The LORD will also be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>

  <p>10 And those who know your name will put their trust in you, for you, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p>

  <p>11 Sing praises to the LORD who dwells in Zion. Declare among the people his doings.</p>

  <p>12 When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them. He does not forget the cry of the humble.</p>

  <p>13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD. Consider my trouble which I suffer from those who hate me and lift me up from the gates of death,</p>

  <p>14 So that I may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in your salvation.</p>

  <p>15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</p>

  <p>16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executes. The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. [<span class="it">Higgaion. Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations who forget God.</p>

  <p>18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten. The expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.</p>

  <p>19 Arise, O LORD. Do not let man prevail. Let the heathen be judged in your sight.</p>

  <p>20 Put them in fear, O LORD, so that the nations may know themselves to be but men. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>
