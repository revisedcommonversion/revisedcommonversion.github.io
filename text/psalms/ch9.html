  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will praise you, O LORD, with my whole heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will show forth all your wonderful works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> I will be glad and rejoice in you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praise to your name, O most High.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> When my enemies are turned back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall fall and perish at your presence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For you have maintained my right and my cause.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You sat on the throne judging right.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You have rebuked the heathen, you have destroyed the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> O enemy, destructions have come to a perpetual end,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have destroyed cities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their memorial has perished with them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> But the LORD shall endure forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has prepared his throne for judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And he shall judge the world in righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The LORD will also be a refuge for the oppressed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a refuge in times of trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And those who know your name will put their trust in you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Sing praises to the LORD who dwells in Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Declare among the people his doings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> When he makes inquisition for blood, he remembers them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not forget the cry of the humble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Have mercy upon me, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Consider my trouble which I suffer from those who hate me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lift me up from the gates of death,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> So that I may show forth all your praise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the gates of the daughter of Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will rejoice in your salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The LORD is known by the judgment which he executes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Higgaion. Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The wicked shall be turned into hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the nations who forget God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> For the needy shall not always be forgotten.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Arise, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let man prevail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the heathen be judged in your sight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Put them in fear, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the nations may know themselves to be but men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, after having recounted the former victories which he had gained, and exalted in lofty strains the grace and power of God in their happy issue, now again, when he sees new enemies and dangers rising up, implores the protection of the same God by whom he had before been delivered, and beseeches him to overthrow the pride of his enemies.</p>
