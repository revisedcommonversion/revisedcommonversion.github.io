  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth. Michtam of David for Teaching: when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.</span>]</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20060.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 60</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, who was now settled upon the throne, and had gained several signal victories, tending to confirm him in the kingdom, in this Psalm exalts the goodness of God, that he might at once express his gratitude, and by conciliating the favor of such as still stood out against his interests, unite the community, which had been rent into factions. Having first adverted to the clear indications of the Divine favor, which proved that God had chosen him to be king, he more particularly calls the attention of the faithful to the oracle itself, in order to convince them that they could only comply with the mind of God, by yielding their consent and approbation to the anointing which he had received from Samuel. Prayers also are offered up throughout the psalm, urging God to perfect what he had begun.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - WBS/KJV: "Philistia, triumph because of me." From the Pulpit Commentary: "The context will not allow this rendering, since Philistia, like the other enemies of Israel, must be triumphed over, and not triumph." Also of note is that other commentaries state that the original rendering could be taken as an ironical expression. LXX: "the Philistines have been subjected to me."</p>
