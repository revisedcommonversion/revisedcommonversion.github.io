  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth. Michtam of David for Teaching: when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand.</span>] O God, you have cast us off. You have scattered us. You have been displeased. O turn yourself to us again.</p>

  <p>2 You have made the earth to tremble. You have broken it. Heal its breaches, for it shakes.</p>

  <p>3 You have shown your people hard things. You have made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>

  <p>4 You have given a banner to those who fear you so that it may be displayed because of the truth. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>5 So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand and hear me.</p>

  <p>6 God has spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice. I will divide Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.</p>

  <p>7 Gilead is mine. And Manasseh is mine. Ephraim also is the strength of my head. Judah is my lawgiver.</p>

  <p>8 Moab is my wash-pot. Over Edom I will cast out my shoe. Philistia, triumph because of me."</p>

  <p>9 Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?</p>

  <p>10 Will you not, O God, who had cast us off, and you, O God, who did not go out with our armies?</p>

  <p>11 Give us help from trouble, for the help of man is vain.</p>

  <p>12 Through God we shall do valiantly, for he will tread down our enemies.</p>
