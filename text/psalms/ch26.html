  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in the LORD; therefore, I shall not slide.</p>

  <p>2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me. Try my mind and my heart.</p>

  <p>3 For your loving-kindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.</p>

  <p>4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p>

  <p>5 I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked.</p>

  <p>6 I will wash my hands in innocence and will compass your altar, O LORD,</p>

  <p>7 So that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all your wondrous works.</p>

  <p>8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of your house and the place where your honor dwells.</p>

  <p>9 Do not gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men,</p>

  <p>10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p>

  <p>11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Redeem me and be merciful to me.</p>

  <p>12 My foot stands in an even place. In the congregations I will bless the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20026.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 26</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm, for the most part, is similar to the preceding. The prophet, oppressed with numerous wrongs, and finding no succor in the world, implores the aid of God, entreating him to undertake the cause of a man unrighteously afflicted, and to assert his innocence. And as his contest was with hypocrites, he appeals to the judgment of God, sharply reproving them for making a false profession of God's name. In the conclusion, as if he had obtained his wish, he promises a sacrifice of praise to God for his deliverance.</p>
