    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> I love the LORD because he has heard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my voice and my supplications.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Because he has inclined his ear to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore I will call upon him as long as I live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The sorrows of death encompassed me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the pains of hell came upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I found trouble and sorrow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Then I called upon the name of the LORD:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"O LORD, I implore you, deliver my soul."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, our God is merciful.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The LORD preserves the simple.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Return to your rest, O my soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For you have delivered my soul from death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my eyes from tears,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my feet from falling.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I will walk before the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the land of the living.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> I believed; therefore, I said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I was greatly afflicted."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I said in my haste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"All men are liars."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> What shall I render to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for all his benefits toward me?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> I will take the cup of salvation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I will pay my vows to the LORD now<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the presence of all his people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Precious in the sight of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is the death of his saints.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> O LORD, truly I am your servant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am your servant, the son of your woman-servant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have loosened my bonds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> I will pay my vows to the LORD now<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the presence of all his people,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> In the courts of the LORD'S house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20116.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 116</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, being delivered out of very great dangers, relates what cruel torment and anguish of mind he endured, and then how remarkably he was preserved by God. The desperate state of matters with him tended to make the power of God in his preservation more conspicuous; for had not God interposed for his deliverance, all hope would have failed. In this way he stirs himself up to gratitude, and acknowledges that he can make no other return to him for his innumerable benefits.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in 2nd Corinthians 4:13.</p>
