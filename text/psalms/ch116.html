  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 I love the LORD because he has heard my voice and my supplications.</p>

  <p>2 Because he has inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call upon him as long as I live.</p>

  <p>3 The sorrows of death encompassed me, and the pains of hell came upon me. I found trouble and sorrow.</p>

  <p>4 Then I called upon the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I implore you, deliver my soul."</p>

  <p>5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous. Indeed, our God is merciful.</p>

  <p>6 The LORD preserves the simple. I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>

  <p>7 Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.</p>

  <p>8 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>

  <p>9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</p>

  <p>10 I believed; therefore, I said, "I was greatly afflicted."</p>

  <p>11 I said in my haste, "All men are liars."</p>

  <p>12 What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits toward me?</p>

  <p>13 I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

  <p>14 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</p>

  <p>15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.</p>

  <p>16 O LORD, truly I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your handmaid. You have loosened my bonds.</p>

  <p>17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

  <p>18 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people,</p>

  <p>19 In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20116.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 116</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, being delivered out of very great dangers, relates what cruel torment and anguish of mind he endured, and then how remarkably he was preserved by God. The desperate state of matters with him tended to make the power of God in his preservation more conspicuous; for had not God interposed for his deliverance, all hope would have failed. In this way he stirs himself up to gratitude, and acknowledges that he can make no other return to him for his innumerable benefits.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in 2nd Corinthians 4:13.</p>
