  <!--chapter text-->

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; The LORD reigns. Let the earth rejoice. Let the multitude of islands be glad.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Clouds and darkness surround him. Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; A fire goes before him and burns up his enemies all around.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; His lightnings enlightened the world. The earth saw and trembled.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Confounded are all those who serve engraved images, who boast themselves of idols. Worship him, all you gods.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Zion heard and was glad. And the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of your judgments, O LORD.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; For you, LORD, are high above all the earth. You are exalted far above all gods.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;You who love the LORD, hate evil. He preserves the souls of his saints. He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20097.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 97</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The description which we have of the kingdom of God in this psalm, does not apply to the state of it under the Law. We may infer, accordingly, that it contains a prediction of that kingdom of Christ, which was erected upon the introduction of the Gospel. The Psalmist, while he commends it to us by insisting upon its greatness and glory, so well calculated to compel the reverential fear of men, gives an amiable representation of it, by informing us that it has been erected for the salvation of mankind sinners.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Possibly quoted in Hebrews 1:6.</p>
