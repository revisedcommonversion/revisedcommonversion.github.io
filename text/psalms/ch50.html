  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of Asaph.</span>] The mighty God, even the LORD, has spoken and called the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.</p>

  <p>2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined.</p>

  <p>3 Our God shall come and shall not keep silence. A fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous around him.</p>

  <p>4 He shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth so that he may judge his people.</p>

  <p>5 "Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</p>

  <p>6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God is judge himself. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, even your God.</p>

  <p>8 I will not reprove you for your sacrifices or your burnt-offerings which have been continually before me.</p>

  <p>9 I will take no bull out of your house, nor male goats out of your folds.</p>

  <p>10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>

  <p>11 I know all the birds of the mountains. And the wild beasts of the field are mine.</p>

  <p>12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.</p>

  <p>13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?</p>

  <p>14 Offer to God thanksgiving and pay your vows to the Most High.</p>

  <p>15 And call upon me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."</p>

  <p>16 But to the wicked, God says, "What have you to do to declare my statutes, or that you should take my covenant in your mouth,</p>

  <p>17 Seeing you hate instruction and cast my words behind you?</p>

  <p>18 When you saw a thief, you consented with him. You have been partaker with adulterers.</p>

  <p>19 You give your mouth to evil and your tongue frames deceit.</p>

  <p>20 You sit and speak against your brother. You slander your own mother's son.</p>

  <p>21 These things you have done, and I kept silence. You thought that I was altogether such a one as yourself. But I will reprove you and set them in order before your eyes.</p>

  <p>22 Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces and there be no one to deliver:</p>

  <p>23 Whoever offers praise glorifies me, and to him who orders his deportment aright I will show the salvation of God."</p>
