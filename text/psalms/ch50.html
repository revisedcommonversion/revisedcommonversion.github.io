  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">The mighty God, even the LORD, has spoken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and called the earth from the rising to the setting of the sun.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />God has shined.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Our God shall come and shall not keep silence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A fire shall devour before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be very tempestuous around him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He shall call to the heavens from above<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the earth so that he may judge his people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> "Gather my saints together to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And the heavens shall declare his righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for God is judge himself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> "Hear, O my people, and I will speak,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Israel, and I will testify against you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am God, even your God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> I will not reprove you for your sacrifices<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or your burnt-offerings which have been continually before me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I will take no bull out of your house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor male goats out of your folds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For every beast of the forest is mine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I know all the birds of the mountains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the wild beasts of the field are mine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> If I were hungry, I would not tell you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the world is mine, and the fullness thereof.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Will I eat the flesh of bulls<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or drink the blood of goats?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Offer to God thanksgiving<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pay your vows to the Most High.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And call upon me in the day of trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> But to the wicked, God says,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"What have you to do to declare my statutes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or that you should take my covenant in your mouth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Seeing you hate instruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast my words behind you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> When you saw a thief, you consented with him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have been partaker with adulterers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> You give your mouth to evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your tongue frames deceit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You sit and speak against your brother.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You slander your own mother's son.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> These things you have done, and I kept silence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You thought that I was altogether such a one as yourself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But I will reprove you and set them in order before your eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Now consider this, you who forget God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest I tear you in pieces and there be no one to deliver:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Whoever offers praise glorifies me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to him who orders his deportment aright<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will show the salvation of God."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20050.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 50</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>There have always been hypocrites in the Church, men who have placed religion in a mere observance of outward ceremonies, and among the Jews there were many who turned their attention entirely to the figures of the Law, without regarding the truth which was represented under them. They conceived that nothing more was demanded of them but their sacrifices and other rites. The following psalm is occupied with the reprehension of this gross error, and the prophet exposes in severe terms the dishonor which is cast upon the name of God by confounding ceremony with religion, showing that the worship of God is spiritual, and consists of two parts, prayer and thanksgiving.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Reference, Matthew 24:31.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Psalm 24:1; 1st Corinthians 10:26, 28.</p>
