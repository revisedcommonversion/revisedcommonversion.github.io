  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Do not fret yourself because of evildoers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither be envious against the workers of iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For they shall soon be cut down like the grass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wither like the green herb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Trust in the LORD and do good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Dwell in the land, and truly you shall be fed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Delight yourself also in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will give you the desires of your heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Commit your way to the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And he will bring forth your righteousness like the light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your judgment like the noon-day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not fret yourself because of him who prospers in his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Cease from anger and forsake wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not fret yourself. It leads only to evil-doing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For evildoers shall be cut off,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall even diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> But the meek shall inherit the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The wicked plots against the just<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gnashes upon him with his teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The Lord will laugh at him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he sees that his day is coming.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword and bent their bow<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cast down the poor and needy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to slay those who are of upright deportment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Their sword shall enter into their own heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their bows shall be broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> A little that a righteous man has is better<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than the riches of many wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD upholds the righteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The LORD knows the days of the upright,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their inheritance shall be forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> They shall not be ashamed in the evil time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> But the wicked shall perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the enemies of the LORD shall be like the fat of lambs.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall consume. Into smoke they shall consume away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The wicked borrows and does not pay back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous shows mercy and gives.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For those who are blessed by him shall inherit the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he delights in his way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Though he should fall, he shall not be utterly cast down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD upholds him with his hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I have been young, and now am old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor his children begging for bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He is ever merciful and lends,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his offspring is blessed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Depart from evil and do good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dwell forevermore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> For the LORD loves judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not forsake his saints.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are preserved forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the offspring of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> The righteous shall inherit the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dwell therein forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his tongue talks of judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The law of his God is in his heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />None of his steps shall slide.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> The wicked watches the righteous<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and seeks to slay him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> The LORD will not leave him in his hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Wait on the LORD and keep his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will exalt you to inherit the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> I have seen the wicked in great power<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> Yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I even sought him, but he could not be found.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> Mark the perfect man and behold the upright,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the end of that man is peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is their strength in the time of trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> And the LORD will help them and deliver them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will deliver them from the wicked and save them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they trust in him.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20037.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 37</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm, the title of which shows it to have been composed by David, contains most profitable instruction. Since the faithful, so long as they pursue their earthly pilgrimage through life, see things strangely confused in the world, unless they assuaged their grief with the hope of a better issue, their courage would soon fail them. The more boldly any man despises God, and runs to every excess in wickedness, so much the more happily he seems to live. And since prosperity appears to be a token of God's favor towards the ungodly, what conclusion, it may be said, can be drawn from this, but either that the world is governed by chance, and that fortune bears the sovereignty, or else that God makes no difference between the good and the bad? The Spirit of God accordingly confirms and strengthens us in this psalm against the assaults of such a temptation. However great the prosperity which the wicked enjoy for a time, he declares their felicity to be transient and evanescent, and that, therefore, they are miserable, while the happiness of which they boast is cursed; whereas the pious and devoted servants of God never cease to be happy, even in the midst of their greatest calamities, because God takes care of them, and at length comes to their aid in due season. This, indeed, is paradoxical, and wholly repugnant to human reason. For as good men often suffer extreme poverty, and languish long under many troubles, and are loaded with reproaches and wrongs, while the wicked and profligate triumph, and are regaled with pleasures, might we not suppose that God cares not for the things that are done on earth? It is on this account that, as I have already said, the doctrine of this psalm is so much the more profitable; because, withdrawing our thoughts from the present aspect of things, it enjoins us to confide in the providence of God, until he stretch forth his hand to help those who are his servants, and demand of the ungodly a strict account of their lives, as of thieves and robbers who have foully abused his bounty and paternal goodness.</p>
