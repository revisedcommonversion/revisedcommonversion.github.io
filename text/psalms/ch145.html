  <p>1 [<span class="it">David's Psalm of Praise.</span>] I will extol you, my God, O king, and I will bless your name forever and ever.</p>

  <p>2 Every day I will bless you and will praise your name forever and ever.</p>

  <p>3 The LORD is great and greatly to be praised, and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>

  <p>4 One generation shall praise your works to another and declare your mighty acts.</p>

  <p>5 I will speak of the glorious honor of your majesty and of your wondrous works.</p>

  <p>6 And men shall speak of the might of your awesome acts. And I will declare your greatness.</p>

  <p>7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of your great goodness and sing of your righteousness.</p>

  <p>8 The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and of great mercy.</p>

  <p>9 The LORD is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>

  <p>10 All your works shall praise you, O LORD, and your saints shall bless you.</p>

  <p>11 They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom and talk of your power,</p>

  <p>12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>

  <p>13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations.</p>

  <p>14 The LORD upholds all who fall and raises up all those who are bowed down.</p>

  <p>15 The eyes of all wait upon you, and you give them their food in due season.</p>

  <p>16 You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living creature.</p>

  <p>17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works.</p>

  <p>18 The LORD is near to all those who call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth.</p>

  <p>19 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him. He also will hear their cry and save them.</p>

  <p>20 The LORD preserves all those who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.</p>

  <p>21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD. And let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.</p>
