  <p>1 [<span class="it">David's Psalm of Praise.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will extol you, my God, O king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will bless your name forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Every day I will bless you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will praise your name forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The LORD is great and greatly to be praised,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> One generation shall praise your works to another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and declare your mighty acts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I will speak of the glorious honor of your majesty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of your wondrous works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And men shall speak of the might of your awesome acts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will declare your greatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They shall abundantly utter the memory of your great goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sing of your righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The LORD is gracious and full of compassion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />slow to anger and of great mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The LORD is good to all,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> All your works shall praise you, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your saints shall bless you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and talk of your power,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your dominion endures throughout all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The LORD upholds all who fall<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and raises up all those who are bowed down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The eyes of all wait upon you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you give them their food in due season.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> You open your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and satisfy the desire of every living creature.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The LORD is righteous in all his ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and holy in all his works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The LORD is near to all those who call upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to all who call upon him in truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He also will hear their cry and save them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The LORD preserves all those who love him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but all the wicked he will destroy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The Psalmist is led to celebrate the praises of God by reflecting upon his excellent wisdom, goodness, and righteousness, both in the government of the world generally, and particularly in managing, superintending, and defending the children of men. After recounting in general the praises of his providence, he comes to speak of the special favor shown by him to his own people.</p>
