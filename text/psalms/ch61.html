  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Neginah. A Psalm of David.</span>] Hear my cry, O God. Attend to my prayer.</p>

  <p>2 From the end of the earth I will cry to you when my heart is overwhelmed. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I am.</p>

  <p>3 For you have been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy.</p>

  <p>4 I will abide in your tabernacle forever. I will trust in the covert of your wings. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>5 For you, O God, have heard my vows. You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.</p>

  <p>6 You will prolong the king's life. His years shall be as many generations.</p>

  <p>7 He shall abide before God forever. O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.</p>

  <p>8 So I will sing praise to your name forever when I daily perform my vows.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20061.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 61</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm begins with prayer, or, at any rate, with the brief record of a prayer, which David had preferred to God in a season of deep distress. It is chiefly occupied, however, with the praises of God, expressing his thankfulness for a miraculous deliverance which he had experienced from some imminent danger, and for his establishment upon the throne.</p>
