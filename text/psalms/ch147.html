  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Praise the LORD, for it is good to sing praises to our God. For it is pleasant, and praise is fitting.</p>

  <p>2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem. He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.</p>

  <p>3 He heals the broken in heart and binds up their wounds.</p>

  <p>4 He tells the number of the stars. He calls them all by their names.</p>

  <p>5 Our Lord is great and of great power. His understanding is infinite.</p>

  <p>6 The LORD lifts up the meek. He casts the wicked down to the ground.</p>

  <p>7 Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving. Sing praise upon the harp to our God,</p>

  <p>8 Who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>

  <p>9 He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</p>

  <p>10 He does not delight in the strength of the horse. He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his mercy.</p>

  <p>12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion.</p>

  <p>13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed your children within you.</p>

  <p>14 He makes peace in your borders and fills you with the finest of the wheat.</p>

  <p>15 He sends forth his commandment upon earth. His word runs very swiftly.</p>

  <p>16 He gives snow like wool. He scatters the hoar-frost like ashes.</p>

  <p>17 He casts forth his ice like morsels. Who can stand before his cold?</p>

  <p>18 He sends out his word and melts them. He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</p>

  <p>19 He shows his word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to Israel.</p>

  <p>20 He has not dealt so with any nation. And as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise the LORD.</p>
