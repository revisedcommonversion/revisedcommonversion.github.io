  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Praise the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it is good to sing praises to our God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For it is pleasant, and praise is fitting.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; The LORD builds up Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; He heals the broken in heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and binds up their wounds.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; He tells the number of the stars.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He calls them all by their names.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Our Lord is great and of great power.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His understanding is infinite.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The LORD lifts up the meek.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He casts the wicked down to the ground.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sing praise upon the harp to our God,</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Who covers the heaven with clouds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who prepares rain for the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who makes grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; He gives to the beast his food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the young ravens which cry.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;He does not delight in the strength of the horse.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not take pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in those who hope in his mercy.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise your God, O Zion.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has blessed your children within you.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;He makes peace in your borders<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fills you with the finest of the wheat.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;He sends forth his commandment upon earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His word runs very swiftly.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;He gives snow like wool.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He scatters the hoar-frost like ashes.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;He casts forth his ice like morsels.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who can stand before his cold?</p>

    <p>18&emsp;He sends out his word and melts them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He causes his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;He shows his word to Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his statutes and his judgments to Israel.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;He has not dealt so with any nation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And as for his judgments, they have not known them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This Psalm also incites the people of God to praise him upon two accounts; first, for the display of his power, goodness, wisdom, and other perfections in the common government of the world, and the several parts of it, the heavens and the earth, but more particularly for his special goodness in cherishing and defending the Church which he has chosen of his free grace, in restoring it when fallen down, and gathering it when dispersed.</p>
