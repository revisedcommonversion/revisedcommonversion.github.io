  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Song or Psalm.</span>] Make a joyful noise to God, all you lands.</p>

  <p>2 Sing forth the honor of his name. Make his praise glorious.</p>

  <p>3 Say to God, "How awesome you are in your works! Through the greatness of your power your enemies shall submit themselves to you.</p>

  <p>4 All the earth shall worship you and sing to you. They shall sing to your name." [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>5 Come and see the works of God. He is awesome in his doings toward the children of men.</p>

  <p>6 He turned the sea into dry land. They went through the flood on foot. There we rejoiced in him.</p>

  <p>7 He rules by his power forever. His eyes behold the nations. Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>8 O bless our God, you people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,</p>

  <p>9 Who holds our soul in life and does not allow our feet to be moved.</p>

  <p>10 For you, O God, have proved us. You have tried us as silver is tried.</p>

  <p>11 You have brought us into the net. You have laid affliction upon our loins.</p>

  <p>12 You have caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us out into a wealthy place.</p>

  <p>13 I will go into your house with burnt-offerings. I will pay you my vows,</p>

  <p>14 Which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.</p>

  <p>15 I will offer to you burnt-sacrifices of fattened calves with the incense of rams. I will offer bulls with goats. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>16 Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my soul.</p>

  <p>17 I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>

  <p>18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</p>

  <p>19 But truly God has heard me. He has attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>

  <p>20 Blessed be God who has not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>
