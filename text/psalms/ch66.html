  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Song or Psalm.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Make a joyful noise to God, all you lands.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Sing forth the honor of his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make his praise glorious.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Say to God, "How awesome you are in your works!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Through the greatness of your power your enemies shall submit themselves to you.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; All the earth shall worship you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sing to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall sing to your name."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Come and see the works of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is awesome in his doings toward the children of men.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; He turned the sea into dry land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They went through the flood on foot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There we rejoiced in him.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; He rules by his power forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His eyes behold the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>8&emsp; O bless our God, you people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make the voice of his praise to be heard,</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Who holds our soul in life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not allow our feet to be moved.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For you, O God, have proved us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have tried us as silver is tried.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;You have brought us into the net.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have laid affliction upon our loins.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;You have caused men to ride over our heads.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We went through fire and through water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you brought us out into a wealthy place.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;I will go into your house with burnt-offerings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will pay you my vows,</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Which my lips have uttered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;I will offer to you burnt-sacrifices of fattened calves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the incense of rams.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will offer bulls with goats.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Come and hear, all you who fear God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will declare what he has done for my soul.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;I cried to him with my mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;If I regard iniquity in my heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Lord will not hear me.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;But truly God has heard me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Blessed be God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has not turned away my prayer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor his mercy from me.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20066.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 66</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>There may have been one deliverance in particular, which the Psalmist celebrates here in the name of the Church, but he includes the many and various mercies which God had all along conferred upon his chosen people. While he takes notice of the divine interposition in their behalf, in a crisis of great mercy and distress, he suggests it as matter of comfort under trial, that their subjection to the tyranny of their enemies had been designed to prove them as silver in the furnace. At the close, he would appear to speak of himself individually, and adduces it as a proof of his integrity, that God had heard him, for God does not grant acceptance to the wicked.</p>
