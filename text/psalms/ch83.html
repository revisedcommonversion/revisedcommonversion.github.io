  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Song or Psalm of Asaph.</span>] Do not keep silent, O God. Do not hold your peace and do not be still, O God.</p>

  <p>2 For behold, your enemies make a tumult, and those who hate you have lifted up the head.</p>

  <p>3 They have taken crafty counsel against your people and consulted against your hidden ones.</p>

  <p>4 They have said, "Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation so that the name of Israel may no longer be in remembrance."</p>

  <p>5 For they have consulted together with one consent. They are confederated against you:</p>

  <p>6 The tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagarenes,</p>

  <p>7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre.</p>

  <p>8 Assur is also joined with them. They have helped the children of Lot. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>9 Do to them as to the Midianites, as to Sisera and to Jabin at the brook of Kison,</p>

  <p>10 Who perished at En-dor. They became as dung for the earth.</p>

  <p>11 Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, even all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna,</p>

  <p>12 Who said, "Let us take for ourselves the houses of God in possession."</p>

  <p>13 O my God, make them like a wheel, as the stubble before the wind.</p>

  <p>14 As the fire burns a wood and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,</p>

  <p>15 So persecute them with your tempest and make them afraid with your storm.</p>

  <p>16 Fill their faces with shame so that they may seek your name, O LORD.</p>

  <p>17 Let them be confounded and troubled forever. Let them even be put to shame and perish,</p>

  <p>18 So that men may know that you, whose name alone is YAHWEH, are the most high over all the earth.</p>
