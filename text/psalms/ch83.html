  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Song or Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Do not keep silent, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not hold your peace and do not be still, O God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For behold, your enemies make a tumult,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who hate you have lifted up the head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They have taken crafty counsel against your people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and consulted against your hidden ones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They have said, "Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the name of Israel may no longer be in remembrance."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For they have consulted together with one consent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are confederated against you:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of Moab and the Hagarenes,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Assur is also joined with them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have helped the children of Lot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Do to them as to the Midianites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as to Sisera and to Jabin at the brook of Kison,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Who perished at En-dor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They became as dung for the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Who said, "Let us take for ourselves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the houses of God in possession."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> O my God, make them like a wheel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the stubble before the wind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> As the fire burns a forest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> So persecute them with your tempest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make them afraid with your storm.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Fill their faces with shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may seek your name, O LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Let them be confounded and troubled forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them even be put to shame and perish,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> So that men may know that you, whose name alone is YAHWEH,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are the most high over all the earth.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The prophet implores the divine aid against the enemies of the Church, and, as an argument for obtaining this the more easily, he enumerates the many nations which had conspired together for the express purpose of exterminating the people of Israel, and thereby extinguishing the very name of the Church of God. To stir up himself and others to greater earnestness and confidence in prayer, he shows, by many examples, how mightily God had been wont to succor his servants.</p>
