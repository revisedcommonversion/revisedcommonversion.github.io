  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David: when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will bless the LORD at all times.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> My soul shall make her boast in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The humble shall hear of it and be glad.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> O magnify the LORD with me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let us exalt his name together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I sought the LORD, and he heard me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivered me from all my fears.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They looked to him and were radiant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their faces were not ashamed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivers them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> O taste and see that the LORD is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed is the man who trusts in him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> O fear the LORD, you his saints,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for there is no lack with those who fear him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The young lions lack and suffer hunger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Come, you children, listen to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> What man is he who desires life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and loves many days, that he may see good?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Keep your tongue from evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your lips from speaking guile.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Depart from evil and do good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seek peace and pursue it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his ears are open to their cry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The face of the LORD is against those who do evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The righteous cry, and the LORD hears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivers them out of all their troubles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The LORD is near to those who are of a broken heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and saves those who are of a contrite spirit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD delivers him out of them all.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He keeps all his bones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one of them is broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Evil shall slay the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The LORD redeems the soul of his servants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and none of those who trust in him shall be desolate.</p>
