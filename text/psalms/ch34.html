  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David: when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</span>] I will bless the LORD at all times. His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>

  <p>2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD. The humble shall hear of it and be glad.</p>

  <p>3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>

  <p>4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears.</p>

  <p>5 They looked to him and were radiant, and their faces were not ashamed.</p>

  <p>6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>

  <p>7 The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him and delivers them.</p>

  <p>8 O taste and see that the LORD is good. Blessed is the man who trusts in him.</p>

  <p>9 O fear the LORD, you his saints, for there is no lack with those who fear him.</p>

  <p>10 The young lions lack and suffer hunger, but those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing.</p>

  <p>11 Come, you children, listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>

  <p>12 What man is he who desires life and loves many days that he may see good?</p>

  <p>13 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile.</p>

  <p>14 Depart from evil and do good. Seek peace and pursue it.</p>

  <p>15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry.</p>

  <p>16 The face of the LORD is against those who do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

  <p>17 The righteous cry, and the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.</p>

  <p>18 The LORD is near to those who are of a broken heart and saves those who are of a contrite spirit.</p>

  <p>19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.</p>

  <p>20 He keeps all his bones. Not one of them is broken.</p>

  <p>21 Evil shall slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>

  <p>22 The LORD redeems the soul of his servants, and none of those who trust in him shall be desolate.</p>
