  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David: when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will bless the LORD at all times.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; My soul shall make her boast in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The humble shall hear of it and be glad.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; O magnify the LORD with me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let us exalt his name together.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; I sought the LORD, and he heard me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivered me from all my fears.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; They looked to him and were radiant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their faces were not ashamed.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivers them.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; O taste and see that the LORD is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed is the man who trusts in him.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; O fear the LORD, you his saints,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for there is no lack with those who fear him.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;The young lions lack and suffer hunger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who seek the LORD shall not lack any good thing.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Come, you children, listen to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;What man is he who desires life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and loves many days, that he may see good?</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Keep your tongue from evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your lips from speaking guile.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Depart from evil and do good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seek peace and pursue it.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his ears are open to their cry.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;The face of the LORD is against those who do evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;The righteous cry, and the LORD hears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivers them out of all their troubles.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;The LORD is near to those who are of a broken heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and saves those who are of a contrite spirit.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Many are the afflictions of the righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD delivers him out of them all.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;He keeps all his bones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Not one of them is broken.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Evil shall slay the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;The LORD redeems the soul of his servants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and none of those who trust in him shall be desolate.</p>
