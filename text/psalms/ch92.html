  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day.</span>] It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,</p>

  <p>2 To show forth your loving-kindness in the morning and your faithfulness every night,</p>

  <p>3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery, upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>

  <p>4 For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.</p>

  <p>5 O LORD, how great your works are! And your thoughts are very deep.</p>

  <p>6 A brutish man does not know, neither does a fool understand this.</p>

  <p>7 When the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever.</p>

  <p>8 But you, LORD, are most high forevermore.</p>

  <p>9 For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish. All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

  <p>10 But you shall exalt my horn like the horn of a wild ox. I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>

  <p>11 My eye also shall see my desire on my enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked who rise up against me.</p>

  <p>12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>

  <p>13 Those who are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>

  <p>14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. They shall be fat and flourishing,</p>

  <p>15 To show that the LORD is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20092.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 92</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm contains an exhortation to praise God, and shows how much ground we have for this exercise from the works of God, insisting, especially, upon his justice, displayed in the protection of his people, and the destruction of the wicked. By such truth it encourages to the practice of righteousness, and preserves us from fainting under the cross of Christ, by proposing to our view a happy issue out of all our afflictions. To deter us, on the other hand, from the commission of iniquity it declares that sinners, however they may prosper for a time, will speedily be destroyed.</p>
