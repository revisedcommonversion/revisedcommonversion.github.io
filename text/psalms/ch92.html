  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> To show forth your loving-kindness in the morning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your faithfulness every night,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will triumph in the works of your hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O LORD, how great your works are!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your thoughts are very deep.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> A brutish man does not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does a fool understand this.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> When the wicked spring as the grass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when all the workers of iniquity flourish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it is that they shall be destroyed forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But you, LORD, are most high forevermore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For behold, your enemies, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for behold, your enemies shall perish.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But you shall exalt my horn like the horn of a wild ox.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> My eye has also seen my enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my ears shall hear the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who rise up against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Those who are planted in the house of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be fat and flourishing,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> To show that the LORD is upright.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20092.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 92</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm contains an exhortation to praise God, and shows how much ground we have for this exercise from the works of God, insisting, especially, upon his justice, displayed in the protection of his people, and the destruction of the wicked. By such truth it encourages to the practice of righteousness, and preserves us from fainting under the cross of Christ, by proposing to our view a happy issue out of all our afflictions. To deter us, on the other hand, from the commission of iniquity it declares that sinners, however they may prosper for a time, will speedily be destroyed.</p>
