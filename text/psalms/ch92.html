  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day.</span>] It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD and to sing praises to your name, O Most High,</p>

  <p>2 To show forth your loving-kindness in the morning and your faithfulness every night,</p>

  <p>3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery, upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>

  <p>4 For you, LORD, have made me glad through your work. I will triumph in the works of your hands.</p>

  <p>5 O LORD, how great your works are! And your thoughts are very deep.</p>

  <p>6 A brutish man does not know, neither does a fool understand this.</p>

  <p>7 When the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever.</p>

  <p>8 But you, LORD, are most high forevermore.</p>

  <p>9 For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish. All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>

  <p>10 But you shall exalt my horn like the horn of a wild ox. I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>

  <p>11 My eye also shall see my desire on my enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked who rise up against me.</p>

  <p>12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree. He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>

  <p>13 Those who are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>

  <p>14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. They shall be fat and flourishing,</p>

  <p>15 To show that the LORD is upright. He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
