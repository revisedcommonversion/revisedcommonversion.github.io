  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Praise the LORD. Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who delights greatly in his commandments.</p>

  <p>2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth. The generation of the upright shall be blessed.</p>

  <p>3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.</p>

  <p>4 To the upright there arises light in darkness. He is gracious, full of compassion, and righteous.</p>

  <p>5 A good man shows favor and lends. He will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>

  <p>6 Surely he shall not be moved forever. The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>

  <p>7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</p>

  <p>8 His heart is established. He shall not be afraid until he sees his desire upon his enemies.</p>

  <p>9 He has dispersed. He has given to the poor. His righteousness endures forever. His horn shall be exalted with honor.</p>

  <p>10 The wicked shall see it and be grieved. He shall gnash with his teeth and melt away. The desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>

  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20112.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 112</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>As the majority of mankind expect to prosper by evil deeds, and as they generally endeavor to enrich themselves by plunder, fraud, and every species of injustice, the prophet enumerates the blessings of God which attend those who worship him in purity, in order that we may know that, in aiming at a life of piety and morality, we shall not lose our reward.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in 2nd Corinthians 9:9.</p>
