  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why are you so far from helping me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the words of my roaring?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> O my God, I cry in the day-time, but you do not hear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the night season, and I am not silent.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> But you are holy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O you who inhabit the praises of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Our fathers trusted in you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They trusted, and you delivered them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They cried to you and were delivered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They trusted in you and were not confounded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> But I am a worm and no man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a reproach of men, and despised by the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All those who see me deride me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shoot out the lip and shake the head, saying,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "He trusted in the LORD that he would deliver him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> But you are he who brought me forth into life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You made me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> I was cast upon you from my birth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are my God from the time I was born.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Do not be far from me, for trouble is near.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For there is no one to help.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Many bulls have surrounded me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Strong bulls of Bashan have compassed me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They gaped upon me with their mouths<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I am poured out like water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all my bones are out of joint.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart is like wax.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is melted in the midst of my body.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My strength is dried up like a potsherd,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my tongue cleaves to my jaws.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you have brought me into the dust of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For dogs have compassed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The assembly of the wicked have enclosed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They pierced my hands and my feet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I may number all my bones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They look and stare upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> They part my garments among them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> But do not be far from me, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O my strength, hasten to help me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Deliver my soul from the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my darling from the power of the dog.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Save me from the lion's mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have heard me from the horns of the wild oxen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> I will declare your name to my brothers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the midst of the congregation I will praise you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> You who fear the LORD, praise him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And fear him, all you offspring of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> For he has not despised nor abhorred<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the affliction of the afflicted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither has he hid his face from him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But when he cried to him, he heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> My praise shall be of you in the great congregation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will pay my vows before those who fear him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> The meek shall eat and be satisfied.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall praise the LORD who seek him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your heart shall live forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> All the ends of the world shall remember and turn to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> For the kingdom is the LORD'S,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he is the governor among the nations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> All those who are fat upon earth shall eat and worship.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And no one can keep his own soul alive.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Posterity shall serve him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> They shall come and declare his righteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to a people who shall be born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that he has done this.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20022.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 22</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David complains in this psalm, that he is reduced to such circumstances of distress that he is like a man in despair. But after having recounted the calamities with which he was so severely afflicted, he emerges from the abyss of temptations, and gathering courage, comforts himself with the assurance of deliverance. At the same time, he sets before us, in his own person, a type of Christ, who he knew by the Spirit of prophecy behoved to be abased in marvellous and unusual ways previous to his exaltation by the Father. Thus the psalm, in the two parts of which it consists, explains that prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 53:8), "He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation?"</p>
  <p>[v.1] - Quoted in Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34.</p>
