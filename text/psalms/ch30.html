  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm and Song: for the dedication of the house of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will extol you, O LORD, for you have lifted me up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; O LORD my God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I cried to you, and you have healed me.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; O LORD, you have brought up my soul from the grave.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have kept me alive so that I should not go down to the pit.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Sing to the LORD, O saints of his,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; For his anger endures but a moment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In his favor is life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Weeping may endure for a night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but joy comes in the morning.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; And in my prosperity I said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I shall never be moved."</p>

    <p>7&emsp; LORD, by your favor you have made my mountain to stand strong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You hid your face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was troubled.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; I cried to you, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And to the LORD I made supplication.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall the dust praise you? Shall it declare your truth?</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />LORD, be my helper.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;You have turned for me my mourning into dancing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,</p>

    <p>12&emsp;To the end that my glory may sing praise to you and not be silent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever.</p>

  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20030.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 30</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David having been delivered from great danger, not only renders thanks to God apart by himself, but at the same time invites and exhorts all the pious to perform the same duty. He then confesses that he had flattered himself too confidently in his prosperity, and that his security had justly been chastised. In the third place, having briefly expressed his sorrow, he returns again to thanksgiving.</p>
