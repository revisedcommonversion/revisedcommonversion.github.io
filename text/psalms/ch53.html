  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Mahalath. Maschil. A Psalm of David.</span>] The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity. There is no one who does good.</p>

  <p>2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any who understood, who sought God.</p>

  <p>3 Every one of them has gone back. They have altogether become filthy. There is no one who does good, not even one.</p>

  <p>4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread and have not called upon God?</p>

  <p>5 There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you. You have put them to shame because God has despised them.</p>

  <p>6 O that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.</p>
