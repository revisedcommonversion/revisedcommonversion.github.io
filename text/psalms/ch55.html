  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David.</span>] Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not hide yourself from my supplication.</p>

  <p>2 Attend to me and hear me. I mourn in my complaint and make a noise,</p>

  <p>3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me.</p>

  <p>4 My heart is severely pained within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</p>

  <p>5 Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.</p>

  <p>6 And I said, "O that I had wings like a dove! For then I would fly away and be at rest.</p>

  <p>7 Behold, then I would wander far off and remain in the wilderness." [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>8 "I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest."</p>

  <p>9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>

  <p>10 Day and night they go about it upon its walls. Also mischief and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>

  <p>11 Wickedness is in the midst of it. Deceit and guile do not depart from her streets.</p>

  <p>12 For it was not an enemy who reproached me—then I could have borne it—neither was it he who hated me who magnified himself against me—then I would have hid myself from him.</p>

  <p>13 But it was you, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance.</p>

  <p>14 We took sweet counsel together and walked to the house of God in company.</p>

  <p>15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell, for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.</p>

  <p>16 As for me, I will call upon God, and the LORD will save me.</p>

  <p>17 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will pray and cry aloud, and he will hear my voice.</p>

  <p>18 He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there were many with me.</p>

  <p>19 God will hear and afflict them, even he who abides of old. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>] Because they have no changes, therefore they do not fear God.</p>

  <p>20 He has put forth his hands against those who are at peace with him. He has broken his covenant.</p>

  <p>21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart. His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.</p>

  <p>22 Cast your burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the righteous to be moved.</p>

  <p>23 But you, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.</p>
