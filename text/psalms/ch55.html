  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Give ear to my prayer, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not hide yourself from my supplication.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Attend to me and hear me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I mourn in my complaint and make a noise,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Because of the voice of the enemy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the oppression of the wicked.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they cast iniquity upon me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in wrath they hate me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> My heart is severely pained within me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and horror has overwhelmed me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And I said, "O that I had wings like a dove!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For then I would fly away and be at rest.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Behold, then I would wander far off<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and remain in the wilderness."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "I would hasten my escape<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the windy storm and tempest."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their languages,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Day and night they go around it upon its walls.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Also mischief and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Wickedness is in the midst of it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deceit and guile do not depart from her streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For it was not an enemy who reproached me—<br />then I could have borne it—<br />neither was it he who hated me who magnified himself against me—<br />then I would have hid myself from him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But it was you, a man my equal,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my guide, and my acquaintance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> We took sweet counsel together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and walked to the house of God in company.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Let death seize upon them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let them go down alive into hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> As for me, I will call upon God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD will save me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Evening, morning, and at noon, I will pray and cry aloud,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will hear my voice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for there were many with me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> God will hear and afflict them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even he who abides of old.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>] <br />Because they have no changes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore they do not fear God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He has put forth his hands against those who are at peace with him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has broken his covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but war was in his heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His words were softer than oil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they were drawn swords.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Cast your burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will never allow the righteous to be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> But you, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But I will trust in you.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20055.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 55</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Many interpreters have thought that this psalm refers to the conspiracy of Absalom, by which David was driven from the throne, and forced to take refuge under circumstances of great distress in the wilderness. But it seems rather to have been written at a period when he was reduced to extreme danger by the persecutions of Saul. It is a prayer, expressive of the deepest distress, and full of fervor, urging every consideration which could be supposed to solicit the compassion of God. After having disburdened his sorrows and given utterance to his requests, the Psalmist contemplates the prospect of deliverance, and offers thanksgivings to God as if he had already obtained it.</p>
