  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm for Solomon.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Give the king your judgments, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your righteousness to the king's son.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> He shall judge your people with righteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your poor with judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The mountains shall bring peace to the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He shall judge the poor of the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall save the children of the needy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and break the oppressor in pieces.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />throughout all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as showers that water the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> In his days the righteous shall flourish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and abundance of peace so long as the moon endures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He shall also have dominion from sea to sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his enemies shall lick the dust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the islands shall bring presents.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Indeed, all kings shall fall down before him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All nations shall serve him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For he shall deliver the needy when he cries,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also the poor and him who has no helper.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He shall spare the poor and needy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and save the souls of the needy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and precious shall be their blood in his sight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And he shall live, and to him the gold of Sheba shall be given.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Prayer shall also be made for him continually,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and daily he shall be praised.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> There shall be a handful of grain in the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the top of the mountains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Its fruit shall shake like Lebanon.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> His name shall endure forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His name shall be continued as long as the sun.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And men shall be blessed in him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All nations shall call him blessed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who only does wondrous things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And blessed be his glorious name forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let the whole earth be filled with his glory.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Amen and amen.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David in this psalm prays to God, in the name of the whole Church, for the continual prosperity of the kingdom which was promised him, and teaches us at the same time, that the true happiness of the godly consists in their being placed under the government of a king who was raised to the throne by the appointment of heaven.</p>
