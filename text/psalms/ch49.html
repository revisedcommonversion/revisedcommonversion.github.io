  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Hear this, all you people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give ear, all you inhabitants of the world,</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Both low and high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />rich and poor together.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; My mouth shall speak of wisdom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; I will incline my ear to a parable.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Why should I fear in the days of evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the iniquity of my heels encompasses me?</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Those who trust in their wealth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,</p>

    <p>7&emsp; None of them can by any means redeem his brother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor give to God a ransom for him</p>

    <p>8&emsp; (For the redemption of their soul is costly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it ceases forever),</p>

    <p>9&emsp; That he should still live forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not see corruption.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For he sees that wise men die;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />likewise the fool and the brutish person perish<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and leave their wealth to others.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their dwelling places to all generations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They call their lands after their own names.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Nevertheless, man being in honor does not abide.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is like the beasts that perish.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Their way is their folly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet their posterity approve their sayings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Like sheep they are laid in the grave.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Death shall feed on them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their beauty shall consume<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the grave from their dwelling.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he shall receive me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Do not be afraid when one is made rich,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the glory of his house is increased,</p>

    <p>17&emsp;For when he dies he shall carry nothing away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His glory shall not descend after him.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Though while he lived he blessed his soul—<br />and men will praise you when you do well to yourself—</p>

    <p>19&emsp;He shall go to the generation of his fathers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall never see light.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;A man who is in honor and does not understand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like the beasts that perish.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20049.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 49</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The wicked and the votaries of worldly pleasure often enjoy prosperity, while such as fear the Lord are exposed to affliction, and disposed to faint under the pressure of it. To moderate that pride which the one class is apt to feel in the midst of their success, and administer a check to the despondency of the other, the Psalmist shows what little reason we have to envy the supposed happiness of the ungodly, which, even when at its height, is vain and evanescent; and he teaches us that good men, however great their trials may be, are objects of the divine regard, and will be eventually delivered from their enemies.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - "and it ceases forever" - From the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary: "that is, the ransom fails, the price is too precious, costly."</p>
