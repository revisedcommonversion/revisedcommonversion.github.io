  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician for the Sons of Korah. Maschil.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">We have heard with our ears, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our fathers have told us what work you did in their days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the times of old:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> How you drove out the heathen with your hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and planted them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />how you afflicted the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast them out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For they did not obtain the land in possession by their own sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither did their own arm save them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but your right hand, your arm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the light of your countenance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you were favorable to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> You are my King, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Command deliverances for Jacob.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Through you we will push down our enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Through your name we will tread them under who rise up against us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For I will not trust in my bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall my sword save me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> But you have saved us from our enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have put them to shame who hated us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> In God we boast all the day long.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will praise your name forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> But you have cast off and put us to shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not go forth with our armies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You make us to turn back from the enemy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who hate us plunder for themselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> You have given us like sheep appointed for food<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and scattered us among the heathen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> You sell your people for nothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not increased your wealth by their price.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You make us a reproach to our neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a scorn and a derision to those who are around us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You make us a by-word among the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a shaking of the head among the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My disgrace is continually before me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the shame of my face has covered me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Because of the voice of him who reproaches and blasphemes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the enemy and avenger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Our heart has not turned back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither have our steps declined from your way,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Though you have severely broken us in the place of jackals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and covered us with the shadow of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or stretched out our hands to a strange god,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Will God not search this out?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For he knows the secrets of the heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Indeed, for your sake we are killed all the day long.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, do not cast us off forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Why do you hide your face<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and forget our affliction and our oppression?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Our belly cleaves to the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Arise for our help<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and redeem us for your mercies' sake.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20044.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 44</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm is divided into three principal parts. In the beginning of it the faithful record the infinite mercy of God towards his people, and the many tokens by which he had testified his fatherly love towards them. Then they complain that they do not now find that God is favorable towards them, as he had formerly been towards their fathers. In the third place, they refer to the covenant which God had made with Abraham, and declare that they have kept it with all faithfulness, notwithstanding the sore afflictions to which they had been subjected. At the same time, they complain that they are cruelly persecuted for no other cause but for having continued steadfastly in the pure worship of God. In the end, a prayer is added, that God would not forget the wrongful oppression of his servants, which especially tends to bring dishonor and reproach upon religion.</p>
  <p>[v.19] - "the place of jackals" - LXX: <span class="gr-heb">τόπῳ κακώσεως</span>—the place of affliction.</p>
