  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With my mouth I will make your faithfulness known to all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For I have said, "Mercy shall be built up forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You will establish your faithfulness in the very heavens."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "I have made a covenant with my chosen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have sworn to David my servant,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> 'I will establish your offspring forever<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and build up your throne to all generations.'"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And the heavens shall praise your wonders, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also your faithfulness in the congregation of the saints.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For who in the heaven can be compared to the LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who among the sons of the mighty can be compared to the LORD?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to be had in reverence by all those who are around him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> O LORD God of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who is mighty like you, O Yah?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your faithfulness is around you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You rule the raging of the sea.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When its waves arise, you still them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You have broken Rahab in pieces like one who is slain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have scattered your enemies with your strong arm.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As for the world and its fullness, you have founded them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The north and the south, you have created them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You have a mighty arm.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your hand is strong and your right hand is high.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Justice and judgment are the habitation of your throne.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Mercy and truth shall go before your face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall walk, O LORD, in the light of your countenance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> In your name they shall rejoice all the day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in your righteousness they shall be exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For you are the glory of their strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in your favor our horn shall be exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> For the LORD is our defense,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Holy One of Israel is our king.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Then you spoke in a vision to your holy one<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and said, "I have laid help upon one who is mighty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> I have found David my servant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With my holy oil I have anointed him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> With him my hand shall be established.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My arm shall also strengthen him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The enemy shall not exact upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And I will beat down his foes before his face<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and afflict those who hate him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in my name his horn shall be exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I will set his hand on the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his right hand on the rivers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He shall cry to me, 'You are my father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my God, and the rock of my salvation.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Also I will make him my first-born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />higher than the kings of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> I will keep my mercy for him forevermore,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my covenant shall stand firmly with him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> I will also make his offspring to endure forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> If his children forsake my law<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not walk in my judgments,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> If they break my statutes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not keep my commandments,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Then I will visit their transgression with the rod<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their iniquity with stripes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Nevertheless, I will not utterly take my loving-kindness from him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> I will not break my covenant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> Once I have sworn by my holiness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not lie to David.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> His offspring shall endure forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his throne as the sun before me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> It shall be established forever like the moon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the faithful witness in the sky."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> But you have cast off and abhorred,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you have been angry with your anointed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> You have made the covenant of your servant void.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> You have broken all his hedges down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> All who pass by the way plunder him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is a reproach to his neighbors.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> You have set up the right hand of his adversaries.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> You have also turned the edge of his sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not made him to stand in the battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> You have made his glory to cease<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> The days of his youth you have shortened.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have covered him with shame.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> How long, LORD, will you hide yourself?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Forever? Shall your wrath burn like fire?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">47</span> Remember how short my time is.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why have you made all men in vain?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">48</span> What man is he who lives and shall not see death?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">49</span> Lord, where are your former loving-kindnesses<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you swore to David in your truth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">50</span> Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />how I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">51</span> With which your enemies have reproached, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with which they have reproached the footsteps of your anointed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">52</span> Blessed be the LORD forevermore.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Amen and amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20089.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 89</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The prophet who wrote this psalm, whoever he was, in approaching the throne of grace to make supplication to God in behalf of the afflicted Church, lays down, as an encouragement both to himself and the rest of the faithful to cherish good hope, the covenant which God had made with David. He then adverts in general to the Divine power which is discerned in the whole government of the world. And next, he calls to remembrance the redemption in which God had given an everlasting testimony of his fatherly love towards his chosen people. Thence, he again returns to the covenant made with David, in which God had promised to continue his favor towards that people for ever, for the sake of their king. Finally, he subjoins a complaint that God, as if he had forgotten his covenant, abandoned his Church to the will of her enemies, and, in the midst of strange disaster and mournful desolation, withheld all succor and consolation.</p>
