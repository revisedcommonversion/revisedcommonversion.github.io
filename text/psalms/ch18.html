  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the Servant of the LORD: who spoke the words of this song to the LORD in the day that the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul, and he said,</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I will love you, O LORD, my strength.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my God, my strength in whom I will trust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; I will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />So I shall be saved from my enemies.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; The sorrows of death compassed me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; The sorrows of hell encompassed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The snares of death seized me.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; In my distress I called upon the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Then the earth shook and trembled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also the foundations of the hills moved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and were shaken, because he was angry.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; There went up a smoke out of his nostrils,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fire out of his mouth devoured.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Coals were kindled by it.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; He bowed the heavens also, and came down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and darkness was under his feet.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;And he rode upon a cherub and flew.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He even flew upon the wings of the wind.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;He made darkness his secret place, his pavilion around him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with hail stones and coals of fire.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;The LORD also thundered in the heavens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Highest gave his voice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with hail stones and coals of fire.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;He even sent out his arrows and scattered them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shot out lightnings and completely defeated them.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Then the channels of waters were seen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the foundations of the world were uncovered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at your rebuke, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;He sent from above, he took me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he drew me out of many waters.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;He delivered me from my strong enemy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;They attacked me in the day of my calamity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD was my stay.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;He also brought me forth in a large place.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He delivered me because he delighted in me.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;For I have kept the ways of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;For all his judgments were before me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;I was also upright before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I kept myself from my iniquity.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Therefore, the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With an upright man you will show yourself upright.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;With the pure you will show yourself pure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With the perverse you will contend.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;For you will save the afflicted people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but will bring down high looks.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;For you will light my candle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;For by you I have run through a troop.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And by my God I have leaped over a wall.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;As for God, his way is perfect.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The word of the LORD is tried.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is a buckler to all those who trust in him.</p>

    <p>31&emsp;For who is God except the LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who is a rock except our God?</p>

    <p>32&emsp;It is God who girds me with strength<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and makes my way perfect.</p>

    <p>33&emsp;He makes my feet like hinds' feet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sets me upon my high places.</p>

    <p>34&emsp;He teaches my hands to war<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.</p>

    <p>35&emsp;You have also given me the shield of your salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your right hand has held me up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your gentleness has made me great.</p>

    <p>36&emsp;You have enlarged my steps under me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my feet have not slipped.</p>

    <p>37&emsp;I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither did I turn back until they were consumed.</p>

    <p>38&emsp;I have wounded them so that they were not able to rise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have fallen under my feet.</p>

    <p>39&emsp;For you have girded me with strength to battle.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</p>

    <p>40&emsp;You have also given me the necks of my enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I might destroy those who hate me.</p>

    <p>41&emsp;They cried, but there was no one to save them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to the LORD, but he did not answer them.</p>

    <p>42&emsp;Then I beat them as small as the dust before the wind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>

    <p>43&emsp;You have delivered me from the strivings of the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have made me the head of the heathen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>

    <p>44&emsp;As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The strangers shall submit themselves to me.</p>

    <p>45&emsp;The strangers shall fade away<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be afraid from their close places.</p>

    <p>46&emsp;The LORD lives. Blessed be my rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>

    <p>47&emsp;It is God who avenges me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and subdues the people under me.</p>

    <p>48&emsp;He delivers me from my enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You even lift me up above those who rise up against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have delivered me from the violent man.</p>

    <p>49&emsp;Therefore, I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sing praises to your name.</p>

    <p>50&emsp;He gives great deliverance to his king<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shows mercy to his anointed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to David, and to his offspring forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20018.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 18</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>We all know through what difficulties and almost insurmountable obstacles David came to the kingdom. Even to the time of Saul's death he was a fugitive, and, as it were, an outlaw, and wearily passed his life in fear, amidst many threatenings and dangers of death. After God had, with his own hand, placed him on the royal throne, he was immediately harassed with the tumults and insurrections of his own subjects, and the hostile faction being superior to him in power, he was often at the point of being completely overthrown. Foreign enemies, on the other hand, severely tried him even to his old age. These calamities he would never have surmounted had he not been aided by the power of God. Having therefore obtained many and signal victories, he does not, as irreligious men are accustomed to do, sing a song of triumph in honor of himself, but exalts and magnifies God the author of these victories, by a train of striking and appropriate epithets, and in a style of surpassing grandeur and sublimity. This psalm, therefore, is the first of those psalms in which David celebrates, in lofty strains, the wonderful grace which God had shown towards him, both in putting him in possession of the kingdom, and in afterwards maintaining him in it. He also shows that his reign was an image and type of the kingdom of Christ, to teach and assure the faithful that Christ, in spite of the whole world, and of all the resistance which it can make, will, by the stupendous and incomprehensible power of the Father, be always victorious.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - This psalm can be found in 2nd Samuel, ch. 22.</p>
  <p>[v.49] - Quoted in Romans 15:9.</p>
