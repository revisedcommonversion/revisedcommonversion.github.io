  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">To you I will cry, O LORD my rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not be silent to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest, if you should be silent to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I should become like those who go down into the pit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I lift my hands toward your holy oracle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Do not draw me away with the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the workers of iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who speak peace to their neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but mischief is in their hearts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavors.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give them after the work of their hands.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Render to them what they deserve.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Because they do not regard the works of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the operation of his hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will destroy them and not build them up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Blessed be the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he has heard the voice of my supplications.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The LORD is my strength and my shield.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart trusted in him, and I am helped;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, my heart greatly rejoices,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with my song I will praise him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The LORD is their strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he is the saving strength of his anointed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Save your people and bless your inheritance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Feed them also and lift them up forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20028.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 28</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After being delivered by God's help from great dangers, David, in this psalm, according to his custom, first records the vows that he had made in the midst of his difficulties, and then his thanksgivings and praises to God, to induce others to follow his example. It is probable that he speaks of his persecutions by Saul.</p>
