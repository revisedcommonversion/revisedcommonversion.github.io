  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] To you I will cry, O LORD my rock. Do not be silent to me, lest, if you should be silent to me, I should become like those who go down into the pit.</p>

  <p>2 Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry to you, when I lift my hands toward your holy oracle.</p>

  <p>3 Do not draw me away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts.</p>

  <p>4 Give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavors. Give them after the work of their hands. Render to them what they deserve.</p>

  <p>5 Because they do not regard the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he will destroy them and not build them up.</p>

  <p>6 Blessed be the LORD because he has heard the voice of my supplications.</p>

  <p>7 The LORD is my strength and my shield. My heart trusted in him, and I am helped; therefore, my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song I will praise him.</p>

  <p>8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.</p>

  <p>9 Save your people and bless your inheritance. Feed them also and lift them up forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20028.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 28</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After being delivered by God's help from great dangers, David, in this psalm, according to his custom, first records the vows that he had made in the midst of his difficulties, and then his thanksgivings and praises to God, to induce others to follow his example. It is probable that he speaks of his persecutions by Saul.</p>
