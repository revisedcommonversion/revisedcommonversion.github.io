    <p>1&emsp; When Israel went out of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the house of Jacob from a people of a foreign language,</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Judah was his sanctuary<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel his dominion.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; The sea saw it and fled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Jordan was driven back.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; The mountains skipped like rams<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the little hills like lambs.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; What ailed you, O sea, that you fled;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Jordan, that you were driven back;</p>

    <p>6&emsp; O mountains, that you skipped like rams;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O little hills, like lambs?</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the presence of the God of Jacob,</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Who turned the rock into a standing water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>

  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20114.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 114</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm contains a short account of that deliverance by which God, in bringing his people out of Egypt: and conducting them to the promised inheritance, gave a proof of his power and grace which ought to be held in everlasting remembrance. The design of that wonderful deliverance was, that the seed of Abraham might yield themselves wholly to God, who, receiving them by a gracious act of adoption, purposed that they should be to him a holy and peculiar people.</p>
