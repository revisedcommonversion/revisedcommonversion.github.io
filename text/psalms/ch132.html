  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Song of Degrees.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">LORD, remember David<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all his afflictions,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> How he swore to the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or go up into my bed,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I will not give sleep to my eyes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or slumber to my eyelids,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Until I find a place for the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We found it in the fields of Jaar.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> We will go into his tabernacles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will worship at his footstool.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Arise, O LORD, into your rest—<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you and the ark of your strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your saints shout for joy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For your servant David's sake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not turn away the face of your anointed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The LORD has sworn in truth to David<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will not turn from it:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"The fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> If your children will keep my covenant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my testimony that I shall teach them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their children shall also sit upon your throne forever."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> For the LORD has chosen Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has desired it for his habitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "This is my rest forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> I will abundantly bless her provision.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> I will also clothe her priests with salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> There I will make the horn of David to bud.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> His enemies I will clothe with shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but upon himself his crown shall flourish."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20132.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 132</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The writer of this Psalm, whoever he may have been here, in the name of all the faithful, puts God in remembrance of his promise, that he would never suffer his house or kingdom to fail, but support and defend both.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "Jaar" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "Jaar is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines until David transferred it to Jerusalem (1st Chronicles 13:5-13)."</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoted in Acts 2:30.</p>
