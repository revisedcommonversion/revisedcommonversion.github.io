  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Song of Degrees.</span>] LORD, remember David and all his afflictions,</p>

  <p>2 How he swore to the LORD and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob:</p>

  <p>3 "Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed,</p>

  <p>4 I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,</p>

  <p>5 Until I find a place for the LORD, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob."</p>

  <p>6 Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah. We found it in the fields of the wood.</p>

  <p>7 We will go into his tabernacles. We will worship at his footstool.</p>

  <p>8 Arise, O LORD, into your rest—you and the ark of your strength.</p>

  <p>9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness and let your saints shout for joy.</p>

  <p>10 For your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of your anointed.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD has sworn in truth to David and he will not turn from it: "Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.</p>

  <p>12 If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne forever."</p>

  <p>13 For the LORD has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.</p>

  <p>14 "This is my rest forever. Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</p>

  <p>15 I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>

  <p>16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>

  <p>17 There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</p>

  <p>18 His enemies I will clothe with shame, but upon himself his crown shall flourish."</p>
