    <h3>Psalm 132</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">In his prayer, David commends to God the religious care he had for the ark. 1-7. His prayer at the removing of the ark, 8-10; with a repetition of God's promises, 11-18.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Song of Degrees.</span>] LORD, remember David and all his afflictions,</p>

  <p>2 How he swore to the LORD and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob:</p>

  <p>3 "Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed,</p>

  <p>4 I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,</p>

  <p>5 Until I find a place for the LORD, a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob."</p>

  <p>6 Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah. We found it in the fields of Jaar.</p>

  <p>7 We will go into his tabernacles. We will worship at his footstool.</p>

  <p>8 Arise, O LORD, into your rest—you and the ark of your strength.</p>

  <p>9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness and let your saints shout for joy.</p>

  <p>10 For your servant David's sake do not turn away the face of your anointed.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD has sworn in truth to David and he will not turn from it: "Of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne.</p>

  <p>12 If your children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon your throne forever."</p>

  <p>13 For the LORD has chosen Zion. He has desired it for his habitation.</p>

  <p>14 "This is my rest forever. Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</p>

  <p>15 I will abundantly bless her provision. I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>

  <p>16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>

  <p>17 There I will make the horn of David to bud. I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</p>

  <p>18 His enemies I will clothe with shame, but upon himself his crown shall flourish."</p>

  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20132.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 132</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The writer of this Psalm, whoever he may have been here, in the name of all the faithful, puts God in remembrance of his promise, that he would never suffer his house or kingdom to fail, but support and defend both.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "Jaar" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "Jaar is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines until David transferred it to Jerusalem (1st Chronicles 13:5-13)."</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoted in Acts 2:30.</p>
