  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] Bless the LORD, O my soul. And all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p>

  <p>2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all his benefits.</p>

  <p>3 It is he who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases,</p>

  <p>4 Who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercies,</p>

  <p>5 Who satisfies your mouth with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>

  <p>6 The LORD executes righteousness and judgment for all who are oppressed.</p>

  <p>7 He made his ways known to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel.</p>

  <p>8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.</p>

  <p>9 He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever.</p>

  <p>10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>

  <p>11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so is his mercy great toward those who fear him.</p>

  <p>12 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.</p>

  <p>13 Like a father pities his children, so the LORD pities those who fear him.</p>

  <p>14 For he knows our frame. He remembers that we are dust.</p>

  <p>15 As for man, his days are as grass. As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</p>

  <p>16 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place shall know it no more.</p>

  <p>17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children,</p>

  <p>18 To those who keep his covenant, and to those who remember his commandments to do them.</p>

  <p>19 The LORD has prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.</p>

  <p>20 Bless the LORD, you angels of his, who excel in strength, who do his commandments, listening to the voice of his word.</p>

  <p>21 Bless the LORD, all you hosts of his, you ministers of his, who do his pleasure.</p>

  <p>22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul.</p>
