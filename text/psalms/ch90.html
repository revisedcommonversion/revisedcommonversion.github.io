  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of Moses the Man of God.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Lord, you have been our dwelling-place<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Before the mountains were brought forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or before you had formed the earth and the world,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You turn man to destruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say, "Return, you children of men."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For a thousand years in your sight<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are like yesterday when it is past<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like a watch in the night.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You carry them away as with a flood. They are like a dream.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the morning they are like grass which grows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> In the morning it flourishes and grows.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the evening it is cut down and withers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For we are consumed by your anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by your wrath we are troubled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> You have set our iniquities before you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />our secret sins in the light of your countenance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For all our days are passed away in your wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We spend our years as a tale that is told.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The days of our years are seventy years.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if by reason of strength they are eighty years,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet their strength is labor and sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Who knows the power of your anger?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even according to your fear, so is your wrath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> So teach us to number our days<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Return, O LORD, how long?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And repent concerning your servants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> O satisfy us early with your mercy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Make us glad according to the days in which you have afflicted us<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the years in which we have seen evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Let your work appear to your servants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your glory to their children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And establish the work of our hands upon us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yes, the work of our hands, establish it.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20090.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 90</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>As Moses is about to treat as well of the brevity and miseries of human life, as of the punishments inflicted upon the people of Israel, in order to minister some consolation for assuaging the grief and fear which the faithful might have entertained upon observing the operation of the common law, to which all mankind are subject, and especially, upon considering their own afflictions, he opens the psalm by speaking of the peculiar grace which God had vouchsafed to his chosen tribes. He next briefly recites, how wretched the condition of men is, if they allow their hearts to rest in this world, especially when God summons them as guilty sinners to his judgment seat. And after he has bewailed, that even the children of Abraham had experienced for a time such severity, that they were almost consumed with sorrow, confiding in God's free favor, by which He had adopted them to himself, he prays that He would deal towards them in a merciful and gracious manner, as he had done in times past, and that he would continue even to the end the ordinary course of his grace.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, 2nd Peter 3:8.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - "They are as a dream" - Or, "They are asleep," as in the sleep of death. From Matthew Henry's Commentary: "[This] is a dreaming life. Men are carried away as with a flood and yet they are as a dream; they consider not their own frailty, nor are aware how near they approach to an awful eternity. Like men asleep, they imagine great things to themselves, until death wakes them, and puts an end to the pleasing dream. Time passes unobserved by us, as it does with men asleep; and, when it is over, it is as nothing."</p>
