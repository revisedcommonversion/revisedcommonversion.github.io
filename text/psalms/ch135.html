    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For I know that the LORD is great<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Whatever the LORD pleased, he did<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in heaven and in earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the seas and all deep places.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He causes the vapors to ascend<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the ends of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes lightnings for the rain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He brings the wind out of his treasuries.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He smote the first-born of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both of man and beast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He sent tokens and wonders<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the midst of you, O Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He smote great nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and slew mighty kings:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Your name, O LORD, endures forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your memorial, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />throughout all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> For the LORD will judge his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have compassion on his servants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The idols of the heathen are silver and gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the work of men's hands.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>An exhortation to praise God, both for his goodness specially shown to his chosen people, and for his power and glory apparent in the world at large. A contrast is drawn between idols, which had but a vain show of divinity, and the God of Israel, who had established his claim to be considered the only true God by clear and indubitable proofs, and this with the view of leading his people the more cheerfully to praise him, and submit to his government.</p>
