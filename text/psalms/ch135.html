  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Praise the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD. Praise him, O servants of the LORD.</p>

  <p>2 You who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,</p>

  <p>3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good. Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant.</p>

  <p>4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>

  <p>5 For I know that the LORD is great and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>

  <p>6 Whatever the LORD pleased, he did in heaven and in earth, in the seas and all deep places.</p>

  <p>7 He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings for the rain. He brings the wind out of his treasuries.</p>

  <p>8 He smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>

  <p>9 He sent tokens and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his servants.</p>

  <p>10 He smote great nations and slew mighty kings:</p>

  <p>11 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan.</p>

  <p>12 He gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel his people.</p>

  <p>13 Your name, O LORD, endures forever, and your memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.</p>

  <p>14 For the LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants.</p>

  <p>15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</p>

  <p>16 They have mouths, but they do not speak. They have eyes, but they do not see.</p>

  <p>17 They have ears, but they do not hear, neither is there any breath in their mouths.</p>

  <p>18 Those who make them are like them, and so is everyone who trusts in them.</p>

  <p>19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel. Bless the LORD, O house of Aaron.</p>

  <p>20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi. You who fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</p>

  <p>21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwells at Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.</p>
