  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I waited patiently for the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he inclined to me and heard my cry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of the miry clay,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set my feet upon a rock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and established my goings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And he has put a new song in my mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even praise to our God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Many shall see it and fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trust in the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Blessed is that man who makes the LORD his trust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not respect the proud<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or those who turn aside to lies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Many, O LORD, my God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are your wonderful works which you have done<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your thoughts which are toward us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They cannot be reckoned up in order to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If I would declare and speak of them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they are more than can be numbered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Sacrifice and offering you did not desire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have opened my ears.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Then I said, "Behold, I come.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the volume of the book it is written about me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> I delight to do your will, O my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your law is even within my heart."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, as you know.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> I have not hid your righteousness within my heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have not concealed your loving-kindness and your truth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the great congregation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Do not withhold your tender mercies from me, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let your loving-kindness and your truth continually preserve me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For innumerable evils have encompassed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My iniquities have taken hold upon me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I am not able to look up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are more than the hairs of my head;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, my heart fails me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who seek after my soul to destroy it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be driven backward and put to shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who wish me evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Let them be desolate by reason of their shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who say to me, "Aha, aha."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let those who love your salvation say continually,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"May the LORD be magnified."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> But I am poor and needy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet the Lord thinks upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are my help and my deliverer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make no delay, O my God.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, being delivered from some great danger, and it may be, not from one only, but from many, extols very highly the grace of God, and by means of this, his soul is filled with admiration of the providence of God, which extends itself to the whole human race. Then he protests that he will give himself wholly to the service of God, and defines briefly in what manner God is to be served and honored. Afterwards, he again returns to the exercise of thanksgiving, and celebrates the praises of the Eternal by rehearsing many of his glorious and powerful deeds. Lastly, when he has complained of his enemies, he concludes the psalm with a new prayer.</p>

  <p>[v.7] - Quoted in Hebrews 10:7, 9.</p>
