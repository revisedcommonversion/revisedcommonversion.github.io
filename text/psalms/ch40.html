  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] I waited patiently for the LORD, and he inclined to me and heard my cry.</p>

  <p>2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings.</p>

  <p>3 And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God. Many shall see it and fear and trust in the LORD.</p>

  <p>4 Blessed is that man who makes the LORD his trust and does not respect the proud, nor those who turn aside to lies.</p>

  <p>5 Many, O LORD, my God, are your wonderful works which you have done and your thoughts which are toward us. They cannot be reckoned up in order to you. If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</p>

  <p>6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire. You have opened my ears. Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required.</p>

  <p>7 Then I said, "Behold, I come. In the volume of the book it is written of me.</p>

  <p>8 I delight to do your will, O my God. Your law is even within my heart."</p>

  <p>9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation. Behold, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, you know.</p>

  <p>10 I have not hid your righteousness within my heart. I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your loving-kindness and your truth from the great congregation.</p>

  <p>11 Do not withhold your tender mercies from me, O LORD. Let your loving-kindness and your truth continually preserve me.</p>

  <p>12 For innumerable evils have encompassed me. My iniquities have taken hold upon me so that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head; therefore, my heart fails me.</p>

  <p>13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me. O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>

  <p>14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it. Let them be driven backward and put to shame who wish me evil.</p>

  <p>15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame who say to me, "Aha, aha."</p>

  <p>16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you. Let those who love your salvation say continually, "May the LORD be magnified."</p>

  <p>17 But I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinks upon me. You are my help and my deliverer. Make no delay, O my God.</p>
