  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</span>] Truly my soul waits upon God. My salvation comes from him.</p>

  <p>2 Only he is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be greatly moved.</p>

  <p>3 How long will you devise mischief against a man? All of you shall be slain. You shall be as a bowing wall and as a tottering fence.</p>

  <p>4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellence. They delight in lies. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>5 My soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is from him.</p>

  <p>6 Only he is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be moved.</p>

  <p>7 In God is my salvation and my glory. The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.</p>

  <p>8 Trust in him at all times, you people. Pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>9 Surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie. They will be laid in the balance. They are altogether lighter than vanity.</p>

  <p>10 Do not trust in oppression and do not become vain in robbery. If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.</p>

  <p>11 God has spoken once, and twice I have heard this: that power belongs to God,</p>

  <p>12 And to you, O Lord, belongs mercy. For you render to every man according to his work.</p>
