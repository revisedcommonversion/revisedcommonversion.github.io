  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Truly my soul waits upon God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My salvation comes from him.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Only he is my rock and my salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is my defense.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall not be greatly moved.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; How long will you devise mischief against a man?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All of you shall be slain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall be as a bowing wall and as a tottering fence.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; They only consult to cast him down from his excellence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They delight in lies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>5&emsp; My soul, wait only upon God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for my expectation is from him.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Only he is my rock and my salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is my defense.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall not be moved.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; In God is my salvation and my glory.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The rock of my strength, my refuge is in God.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Trust in him at all times, you people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pour out your heart before him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />God is a refuge for us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They will be laid in the balance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are altogether lighter than vanity.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Do not trust in oppression<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not become vain in robbery.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;God has spoken once,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and twice I have heard this:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that power belongs to God,</p>

    <p>12&emsp;And to you, O Lord, belongs mercy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For you render to every man according to his work.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20062.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 62</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The greater part of this psalm is occupied with meditations, in which David encourages himself and others to hope in God, and fortifies his mind against the assaults of temptation. And as we are ever prone to be drawn away from God by the influence which worldly objects exert over our senses, perishing and evanescent as these are, occasion is taken to show the folly of this, and bring us to a single and entire dependence upon God.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Quoted in Matthew 16:27; Romans 2:6. Reference, Proverbs 24:12; Ephesians 6:8.</p>
