  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Save me, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the waters have come to my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> I sink in deep mire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where there is no standing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have come into deep waters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where the floods overflow me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I am weary of my crying.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My throat is dried.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Those who hate me without a cause<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are more than the hairs of my head.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who would destroy me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />being my enemies without cause,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are mighty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then I restored that which I did not take away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O God, you know my foolishness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my sins are not hid from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Do not let those who wait on you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Lord GOD of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />be ashamed for my sake.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let those who seek you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />be confounded for my sake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O God of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Because for your sake I have borne reproach.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shame has covered my face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> I have become a stranger to my brothers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a foreigner to my mother's children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For the zeal of your house has eaten me up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the reproaches of those who reproached you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have fallen upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that was to my reproach.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I also made sackcloth my garment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and became a proverb to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Those who sit in the gate speak against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I was the song of the drunkards.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in an acceptable time.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O God, in the multitude of your mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />hear me in the truth of your salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Deliver me out of the mire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let me sink.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let me be delivered from those who hate me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and out of the deep waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Do not let the flood waters overflow me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither let the deep swallow me up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Hear me, O LORD, for your loving-kindness is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Turn to me according to the multitude of your tender mercies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And do not hide your face from your servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am in trouble. Hear me speedily.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Draw near to my soul and redeem it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deliver me because of my enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> You have known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My adversaries are all before you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for comforters, but I found none.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> They also gave me gall for my food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Let their table become a snare before them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And that which should have been for their welfare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />let it become a trap.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Let their eyes be darkened so that they do not see<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make their loins continually shake.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Pour out your indignation upon them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Let their habitation be desolate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let no one dwell in their tents.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> For they persecute him whom you have smitten<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and talk to the grief of those whom you have wounded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Add iniquity to their iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And do not let them come into your righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not be written with the righteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> But I am poor and sorrowful.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> I will praise the name of God with a song<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or bull that has horns and hooves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> The humble shall see this and be glad.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you who seek God, your heart shall live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> For the LORD hears the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not despise his prisoners.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Let the heaven and earth praise him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the seas and everything that moves therein.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may dwell there and have it in possession.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> The offspring of his servants shall also inherit it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those who love his name shall dwell therein.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20069.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 69</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>There is a close resemblance between this psalm and the twenty-second. In the opening verses, David complains of the barbarous cruelty of his enemies, and of the grievous wrongs which they had inflicted upon him. But his mind, he affirms, was not hereby reduced to such a state of distress as to prevent him from patiently relying on the protection of God, or to discourage him from continuing in the undeviating course of a holy and an upright life. He rather testifies that his piety, and the courage and activity which he had manifested in maintaining the interests of the divine glory, were the cause of the hostility borne to him by the generality of men. After having again complained of being not less shamefully than cruelly oppressed by his enemies, he invokes God to visit them with deserved punishment. In the close, exulting as if he had obtained his highest wishes, he engages to yield to God a solemn sacrifice of praise.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "Under the figure of waters, the Psalmist represents his condition as so extremely distressing that it brought him even to the brink of despair; and yet we know that, so far from being a soft and an effeminate person, he was one who encountered and overcame dreadful temptations with extraordinary courage. [From there] we may infer the bitterness of the distress with which he was at that time afflicted. Some understand the word soul as denoting life; but this gives a very cold and unsatisfactory meaning. It rather signifies the heart. A man when he falls into an abyss of waters, may prevent for some time the water from entering his body, by stopping his mouth and his nostrils, but at length, from its being impossible for a human being to live without respiration, suffocation will compel him to let in the waters, and they will penetrate even to the heart. David by this metaphor would intimate, not only that the waters had covered and overwhelmed him, but also that he had been forced to draw them into his body."</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, John 15:25.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in John 2:17; Romans 15:3.</p>
  <p>[v.22-23] - Quoted in Romans 11:9-10.</p>
  <p>[v.25] - Quoted in Acts 1:20.</p>
