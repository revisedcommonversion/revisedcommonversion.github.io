  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> O my God, I trust in you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let me be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let my enemies triumph over me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Also, let no one who waits for you be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be ashamed who transgress without cause.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Show me your ways, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Teach me your paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Lead me in your truth and teach me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are the God of my salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />On you I wait all the day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Remember, O LORD, your tender mercies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your loving kindnesses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have always been from of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Do not remember the sins of my youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor my transgressions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />According to your mercy remember me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your goodness' sake, O LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Good and upright is the LORD;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, he will teach sinners in the way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He will guide the meek in judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the meek he will teach his way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For your name's sake, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> What man is he who fears the LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall teach him in the way that he chooses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> His soul shall dwell at ease<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his offspring shall inherit the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The secret of the LORD is with those who fear him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will show them his covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My eyes are continually toward the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he will pluck my feet out of the net.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Turn to me and have mercy upon me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am desolate and afflicted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The troubles of my heart are enlarged.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O bring me out of my distresses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Look upon my affliction and my pain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and forgive all my sins.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Consider my enemies, for they are many,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they hate me with cruel hatred.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> O keep my soul and deliver me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let me be ashamed, for I put my trust in you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I wait on you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Redeem Israel, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />out of all his troubles.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20025.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 25</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm consists of meditations mingled with prayers. Being rudely treated, and grievously distressed, by the cruelty of his enemies, David, in order to obtain assistance from God, first acknowledges that God had justly made use of this as a means of chastising and punishing him for his sins; and, therefore, he prays for their forgiveness, that he may at once enjoy assurance of the divine favor, and obtain deliverance. He then implores the aid of the Holy Spirit, that, sustained by it, he might, even in the midst of so many temptations, continue in the fear of God. And in various places he intermingles meditation, as the means of stirring up himself to increased confidence in God, and of withdrawing his thoughts from the allurements of the world.</p>
