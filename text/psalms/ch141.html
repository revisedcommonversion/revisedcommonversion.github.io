  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">LORD, I cry to you. Make haste to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give ear to my voice when I cry to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Let my prayer be set forth before you as incense,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Keep the door of my lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Do not incline my heart to any evil thing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or to practice wicked works<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with men who work iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And do not let me eat of their dainties.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Let the righteous smite me—it shall be a kindness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let him reprove me—it shall be an excellent oil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which shall not break my head.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For yet my prayer shall also be in their calamities.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> When their judges are overthrown in stony places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as when one cuts and cleaves wood upon the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But my eyes are to you, O GOD the Lord.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My trust is in you. Do not leave my soul destitute.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the traps of the workers of iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Let the wicked fall into their own nets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />while I escape.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20141.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 141</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Whatever may have been the immediate cause pressing David to pray in the manner he does in this Psalm, it is plain that his desire is through divine grace to check and bridle his spirit, under injuries of a causeless and unprovoked description, so as not to break out into retaliation and revenge, and return evil for evil. Having attained to the exercise of forbearance, he seeks that God would judge between him and his enemies.</p>
