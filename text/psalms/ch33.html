  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, for praise is proper for the upright.</p>

  <p>2 Praise the LORD with the harp. Sing to him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</p>

  <p>3 Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a loud noise.</p>

  <p>4 For the word of the LORD is right and all his works are done in truth.</p>

  <p>5 He loves righteousness and judgment. The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>

  <p>6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>

  <p>7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the depth in store-houses.</p>

  <p>8 Let all the earth fear the LORD. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>

  <p>9 For he spoke, and it was done. He commanded, and it stood fast.</p>

  <p>10 The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing. He makes the devices of the people of no effect.</p>

  <p>11 The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>

  <p>12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD and the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.</p>

  <p>13 The LORD looks from heaven. He beholds all the sons of men.</p>

  <p>14 From the place of his habitation he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

  <p>15 He fashions their hearts alike. He considers all their works.</p>

  <p>16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</p>

  <p>17 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</p>

  <p>18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, upon those who hope in his mercy,</p>

  <p>19 To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.</p>

  <p>20 Our soul waits for the LORD. He is our help and our shield.</p>

  <p>21 For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>

  <p>22 Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in you.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20033.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 33</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, or whoever was the author of this psalm, in order to excite believers to praise God, founds his argument upon the general providence of God, by which he sustains, protects, and governs the whole world. Afterwards he celebrates God's paternal kindness towards his chosen people, showing at the same time how necessary it is that the godly should be cherished by his special care.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Reference, Genesis 1:6-8.</p>
