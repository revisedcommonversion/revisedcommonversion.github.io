  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous, for praise is proper for the upright.</p>

  <p>2 Praise the LORD with harp. Sing to him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</p>

  <p>3 Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully with a loud noise.</p>

  <p>4 For the word of the LORD is right and all his works are done in truth.</p>

  <p>5 He loves righteousness and judgment. The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>

  <p>6 By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>

  <p>7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap. He lays up the depth in store-houses.</p>

  <p>8 Let all the earth fear the LORD. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>

  <p>9 For he spoke, and it was done. He commanded, and it stood fast.</p>

  <p>10 The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing. He makes the devices of the people of no effect.</p>

  <p>11 The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>

  <p>12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD and the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.</p>

  <p>13 The LORD looks from heaven. He beholds all the sons of men.</p>

  <p>14 From the place of his habitation he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

  <p>15 He fashions their hearts alike. He considers all their works.</p>

  <p>16 There is no king saved by the multitude of a host. A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</p>

  <p>17 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</p>

  <p>18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him, upon those who hope in his mercy,</p>

  <p>19 To deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine.</p>

  <p>20 Our soul waits for the LORD. He is our help and our shield.</p>

  <p>21 For our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>

  <p>22 Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in you.</p>
