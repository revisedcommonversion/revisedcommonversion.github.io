    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Rejoice in the LORD, O you righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for praise is fitting for the upright.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Praise the LORD with the harp.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sing to him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Sing to him a new song.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Play skillfully with a loud noise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For the word of the LORD is right,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all his works are done in truth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> He loves righteousness and judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He lays up the depth in store-houses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Let all the earth fear the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For he spoke, and it was done.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He commanded, and it stood fast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The LORD brings the counsel of the heathen to nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes the devices of the people of no effect.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The counsel of the LORD stands forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The LORD looks from heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He beholds all the sons of men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> From the place of his habitation he looks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He fashions their hearts alike.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He considers all their works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude of a host.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> A horse is a vain thing for safety,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon those who hope in his mercy,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> To deliver their soul from death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to keep them alive in famine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Our soul waits for the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is our help and our shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> For our heart shall rejoice in him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Let your mercy, O LORD, be upon us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according as we hope in you.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20033.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 33</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, or whoever was the author of this psalm, in order to excite believers to praise God, founds his argument upon the general providence of God, by which he sustains, protects, and governs the whole world. Afterwards he celebrates God's paternal kindness towards his chosen people, showing at the same time how necessary it is that the godly should be cherished by his special care.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Reference, Genesis 1:6-8.</p>
