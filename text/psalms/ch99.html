  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The LORD reigns. Let the people tremble. He sits between the cherubim. Let the earth be moved.</p>

  <p>2 The LORD is great in Zion and he is high above all people.</p>

  <p>3 Let them praise your great and awesome name, for it is holy.</p>

  <p>4 The king's strength also loves judgment. You establish equity. You execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</p>

  <p>5 Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his footstool, for he is holy.</p>

  <p>6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name, they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.</p>

  <p>7 He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar. They kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them.</p>

  <p>8 You answered them, O LORD our God. You were a God who forgave them, though you took vengeance on their inventions.</p>

  <p>9 Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his holy hill, for the LORD our God is holy.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20099.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 99</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm differs from those which precede it in one respect, that it speaks of the kingdom of God, and the blessings consequent upon it, as confined within Judea; and rather calls upon the posterity of Abraham, in distinction from the surrounding nations, to praise God for the privilege of their adoption.</p>
