  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">The heavens declare the glory of God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the firmament shows the work of his hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Day to day utters speech,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and night to night shows knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> There is no speech nor language<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where their voice is not heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Their line has gone out through all the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their words to the end of the world.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It rejoices like a strong man running a race.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Its going forth is from the end of the heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its circuit to its ends,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is nothing hid from its heat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The testimony of the LORD is sure, making the simple wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They are to be more desired than gold, even much fine gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also sweeter than honey and the honey-comb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Moreover, by them your servant is warned,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in keeping them there is great reward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Who can understand his errors?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cleanse me from secret faults.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let them have dominion over me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then I shall be upright<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be innocent from the great transgression.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20019.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 19</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, with the view of encouraging the faithful to contemplate the glory of God, sets before them in the first place, a mirror of it in the fabric of the heavens, and in the exquisite order of their workmanship which we behold; and in the second place, he recalls our thoughts to the Law, in which God made himself more familiarly known to his chosen people. Taking occasion from this, he continues to discourse at considerable length on this peculiar gift of Heaven, commending and exalting the use of the law. Finally, he concludes the psalm with a prayer.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Quoted in Romans 10:18.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - The pronouns in this verse were changed to third person neuter to avoid any confusion in the subject of this verse. "Its" refers to the sun mentioned at the end of verse 4.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in Revelation 19:2.</p>
