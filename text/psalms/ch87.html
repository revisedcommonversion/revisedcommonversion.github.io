    <p class="in-verse">His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; The LORD loves the gates of Zion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Glorious things are spoken of you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O city of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20087.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 87</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The miserable and distressing condition in which the Church was placed after the Babylonish captivity, might be apt to sink the minds of the godly into despondency; and, accordingly, the Holy Spirit here promises her restoration in a wonderful and incredible manner, so that nothing would be more desirable than to be reckoned among the number of her members.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "when he registers the people" - From Matthew Poole's Commentary: "The sense is, when God, the Maker and Governor of this city, shall take a survey of all his citizens and subjects. It is an allusion to princes or governors of cities that use to write and keep a register of all their people." From the Pulpit Commentary: "He shall enregister every individual among the converted nations as a true citizen of Zion, entitled to all covenant privileges."</p>
