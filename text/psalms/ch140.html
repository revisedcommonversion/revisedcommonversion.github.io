  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil men. Preserve me from the violent men,</p>

  <p>2 Who devise mischiefs in their heart. Continually they are assembled for war.</p>

  <p>3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent. Adder's poison is under their lips. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Preserve me from the violent men who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>

  <p>5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and also cords. They have spread a net by the wayside. They have set gins for me. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>6 I said to the LORD, "You are my God." Hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.</p>

  <p>7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle.</p>

  <p>8 Do not grant, O LORD, the desires of the wicked. Do not further his wicked device, lest they exalt themselves. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>9 As for the head of those who encompass me, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>

  <p>10 Let burning coals fall upon them. Let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, so that they do not rise again.</p>

  <p>11 Do not let an evil speaker be established on the earth. Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</p>

  <p>12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor.</p>

  <p>13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name. The upright shall dwell in your presence.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David complains of the implacable cruelty of his enemies, and of their treachery and rancorous calumnies. In the close, having besought God's help, and expressing his persuasion of obtaining his layout, he comforts himself with the hope of deliverance, and just vengeance being executed upon his enemies.</p>
  <p>[v.3] - Quoted in Romans 3:13.</p>
