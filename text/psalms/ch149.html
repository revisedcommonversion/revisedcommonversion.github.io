  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.</p>

  <p>2 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them. Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.</p>

  <p>3 Let them praise his name in the dance. Let them sing praises to him with the tambourine and harp.</p>

  <p>4 For the LORD takes pleasure in his people. He will beautify the meek with salvation.</p>

  <p>5 Let the saints be joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their beds.</p>

  <p>6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand,</p>

  <p>7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people,</p>

  <p>8 To bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron,</p>

  <p>9 To execute upon them the judgment written. All his saints have this honor. Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20149.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 149</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>If we may be allowed to compare this Psalm with the former ones, and the next, which is the last, the only difference is, that while the author of the Psalm, whoever he was, has hitherto spoken of God's special care and protection of his Church in connection with the common providential government of the world, here he speaks of his benefits to the Church exclusively. In the next Psalm mention is only made of the power of God in general.</p>
