  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In you, O LORD, I put my trust. Let me never be put to confusion.</p>

  <p>2 Deliver me in your righteousness and cause me to escape. Incline your ear to me and save me.</p>

  <p>3 Be my strong habitation to which I may continually resort. You have given commandment to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.</p>

  <p>4 Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>

  <p>5 For you are my hope, O Lord GOD. You are my trust from my youth.</p>

  <p>6 I have been sustained by you from my birth. You are he who brought me into life. My praise shall be continually of you.</p>

  <p>7 I am as a wonder to many, but you are my strong refuge.</p>

  <p>8 Let my mouth be filled with your praise and with your honor all the day.</p>

  <p>9 Do not cast me off in the time of old age. Do not forsake me when my strength fails.</p>

  <p>10 For my enemies speak against me, and those who lay in wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>

  <p>11 Saying, "God has forsaken him. Persecute and take him, for there is no one to deliver him."</p>

  <p>12 O God, do not be far from me. O my God, make haste for my help.</p>

  <p>13 Let them be confounded and consumed who are adversaries to my soul. Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor who seek my hurt.</p>

  <p>14 But I will hope continually and will yet praise you more and more.</p>

  <p>15 My mouth shall show forth your righteousness and your salvation all the day, for I do not know the numbers thereof.</p>

  <p>16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD. I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours only.</p>

  <p>17 O God, you have taught me from my youth, and until now I have declared your wondrous works.</p>

  <p>18 And even when I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not forsake me, until I have shown your strength to this generation and your power to everyone who is to come.</p>

  <p>19 Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, who have done great things. O God, who is like you?</p>

  <p>20 You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, will revive me again and bring me back from the depths of the earth.</p>

  <p>21 You will increase my greatness and comfort me on every side.</p>

  <p>22 I will also praise you with the psaltery, even your truth, O my God. To you I will sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.</p>

  <p>23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to you, along with my soul which you have redeemed.</p>

  <p>24 My tongue shall also talk of your righteousness all the day long. For they are confounded, for they are brought to shame who seek my hurt.</p>
