    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Deliver me in your righteousness and cause me to escape.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incline your ear to me and save me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Be my strong habitation to which I may continually resort.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have given commandment to save me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are my rock and my fortress.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For you are my hope, O Lord GOD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are my trust from my youth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I have been sustained by you from my birth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are he who brought me into life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My praise shall be continually of you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> I am as a wonder to many,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you are my strong refuge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Let my mouth be filled with your praise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with your honor all the day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Do not cast me off in the time of old age.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not forsake me when my strength fails.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> For my enemies speak against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who lie in wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Saying, "God has forsaken him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Persecute and take him, for there is no one to deliver him."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> O God, do not be far from me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O my God, make haste for my help.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Let them be confounded and consumed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who are adversaries to my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who seek my hurt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> But I will hope continually<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will yet praise you more and more.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My mouth shall show forth your righteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your salvation all the day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I do not know the numbers thereof.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours only.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> O God, you have taught me from my youth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and until now I have declared your wondrous works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And even when I am old and gray-headed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O God, do not forsake me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I have shown your strength to this generation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your power to everyone who is to come.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Your righteousness also, O God, is very high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who have done great things. O God, who is like you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You, who have shown me great and severe troubles,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will revive me again<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bring me back from the depths of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> You will increase my greatness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and comfort me on every side.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> I will also praise you with the psaltery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even your truth, O my God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To you I will sing with the harp,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />along with my soul which you have redeemed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> My tongue shall also talk<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of your righteousness all the day long.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they are confounded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are brought to shame who seek my hurt.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, having spoken at the outset of his confidence in God, partly calls upon him for deliverance, and partly complains of the pride of his enemies. At length, to confirm his faith, he prepares himself for yielding a grateful ascription of praise for the benefits which God had conferred upon him.</p>
