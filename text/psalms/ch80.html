  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.</span>] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.</p>

  <p>2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your strength and come and save us.</p>

  <p>3 Turn us back, O God, and cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>

  <p>4 O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?</p>

  <p>5 You feed them with the bread of tears and give them tears to drink in great measure.</p>

  <p>6 You make us a strife to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>

  <p>7 Turn us back, O God of hosts, and cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>

  <p>8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt. You have cast out the heathen and planted it.</p>

  <p>9 You prepared room before it and caused it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>

  <p>10 The hills were covered with its shade, and its boughs were like the beautiful cedars.</p>

  <p>11 She sent out her boughs to the sea and her branches to the river.</p>

  <p>12 Why have you then broke down her hedges so that all those who pass by the way pluck her?</p>

  <p>13 The boar from the wood wastes it and the wild beast of the field devours it.</p>

  <p>14 Return, we implore you, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven and behold. Visit this vine,</p>

  <p>15 The vineyard which your right hand planted, the branch that you made strong for yourself.</p>

  <p>16 It is burnt with fire. It is cut down. They perish at the rebuke of your countenance.</p>

  <p>17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</p>

  <p>18 Then we will not go back from you. Revive us, and we will call upon your name.</p>

  <p>19 Turn us back, O LORD God of hosts, cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>
