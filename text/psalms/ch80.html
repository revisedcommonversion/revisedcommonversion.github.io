  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who lead Joseph like a flock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />stir up your strength<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and come and save us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Turn us back, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> O LORD God of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> You feed them with the bread of tears<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give them tears to drink in great measure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You make us a strife to our neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Turn us back, O God of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> You have brought a vine out of Egypt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have cast out the heathen and planted it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You cleared a place before it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it took deep root and filled the land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The hills were covered with its shade,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its boughs were like the beautiful cedars.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> She sent out her boughs to the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her branches to the river.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Why have you then broken down her hedges<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that all those who pass by the way pluck her?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The boar from the forest wastes it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wild beast of the field devours it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Return, we implore you, O God of hosts.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Look down from heaven and behold. Visit this vine,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The vineyard which your right hand planted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the branch that you made strong for yourself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> It is burnt with fire. It is cut down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They perish at the rebuke of your countenance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Then we will not go back from you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Revive us, and we will call upon your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Turn us back, O LORD God of hosts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />cause your face to shine, and we shall be saved.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This is a sorrowful prayer, in which the faithful beseech God that he would be graciously pleased to succor his afflicted Church. To excite him the more readily to grant them relief in their distressing circumstances, they compare these circumstances with the condition of the Church in her beginnings, when the Divine favor was conspicuously manifested towards her.</p>
