  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim for the Sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of Love.</span>] My heart is inditing a good matter. I speak of the things which I have made concerning the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p>

  <p>2 You are fairer than the children of men. Grace is poured into your lips; therefore, God has blessed you forever.</p>

  <p>3 Gird your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty, with your glory and your majesty.</p>

  <p>4 And in your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, meekness, and righteousness. And your right hand shall teach you awesome things.</p>

  <p>5 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies, by which the people fall under you.</p>

  <p>6 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.</p>

  <p>7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</p>

  <p>8 All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia. Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.</p>

  <p>9 Kings' daughters were among your honorable women. Upon your right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>

  <p>10 Listen, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear. Also forget your own people and your father's house.</p>

  <p>11 And the king shall greatly desire your beauty, for he is your lord. Worship him.</p>

  <p>12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift. Even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.</p>

  <p>13 The king's daughter is all glorious within. Her clothing is of wrought gold.</p>

  <p>14 She shall be brought to the king in clothing of needle-work. The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.</p>

  <p>15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought. They shall enter into the king's palace.</p>

  <p>16 In place of your fathers will be your children, whom you may make princes in all the earth.</p>

  <p>17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore, the people shall praise you forever and ever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20045.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 45</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm, the grace and beauty of Solomon, his virtues in ruling the kingdom, and also his power and riches, are illustrated and described in terms of high commendation. More especially, as he had taken to wife a stranger out of Egypt, the blessing of God is promised to him in this relationship, provided the newly espoused bride, bidding adieu to her own nation, and renouncing all attachment to it, devote herself wholly to her husband. At the same time, there can be no doubt, that under this figure the majesty, wealth, and extent of Christ's kingdom are described and illustrated by appropriate terms, to teach the faithful that there is no felicity greater or more desirable than to live under the reign of this king, and to be subject to his government.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:8.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:9.</p>
