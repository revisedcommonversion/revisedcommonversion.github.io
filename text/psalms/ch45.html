  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim for the Sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of Love.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">My heart is inditing a good matter.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I speak of the things which I have made concerning the king.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> You are fairer than the children of men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Grace is poured into your lips;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, God has blessed you forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Gird your sword upon your thigh, O most mighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with your glory and your majesty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And in your majesty ride prosperously<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of truth, meekness, and righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your right hand shall teach you awesome things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Your arrows are sharp<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the heart of the king's enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by which the people fall under you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> You love righteousness and hate wickedness;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, God, your God, has anointed you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Kings' daughters were among your honorable women.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Upon your right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Listen, O daughter, consider, and incline your ear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Also forget your own people and your father's house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And the king shall greatly desire your beauty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he is your lord. Worship him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even the rich among the people shall entreat your favor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The king's daughter is all glorious within.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her clothing is of wrought gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> She shall be brought to the king in clothing of needle-work.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The virgins, her companions who follow her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be brought to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall enter into the king's palace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> In place of your fathers will be your children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom you may make princes in all the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I will make your name to be remembered in all generations;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, the people shall praise you forever and ever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20045.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 45</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm, the grace and beauty of Solomon, his virtues in ruling the kingdom, and also his power and riches, are illustrated and described in terms of high commendation. More especially, as he had taken to wife a stranger out of Egypt, the blessing of God is promised to him in this relationship, provided the newly espoused bride, bidding adieu to her own nation, and renouncing all attachment to it, devote herself wholly to her husband. At the same time, there can be no doubt, that under this figure the majesty, wealth, and extent of Christ's kingdom are described and illustrated by appropriate terms, to teach the faithful that there is no felicity greater or more desirable than to live under the reign of this king, and to be subject to his government.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:8.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:9.</p>
