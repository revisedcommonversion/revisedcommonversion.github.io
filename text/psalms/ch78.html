  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Give ear, O my people, to my law.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incline your ear to the words of my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> I will open my mouth in a parable.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will utter dark sayings of old,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Which we have heard and known<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and our fathers have told us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> We will not hide them from their children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and appointed a law in Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which he commanded our fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that they should make them known to their children,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> So that the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who should arise and declare them to their children;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> So that they might set their hope in God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and not forget the works of God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but keep his commandments,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And might not be as their fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a stubborn and rebellious generation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a generation that did not set their heart aright<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />turned back in the day of battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They did not keep the covenant of God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and refused to walk in his law,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And forgot his works<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his wonders that he had shown them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He made the waters to stand as a heap.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> In the day-time he also led them with a cloud<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the night with a light of fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He also brought streams out of the rock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And they sinned yet more against him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And they tested God in their heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by asking food for their desire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> They even spoke against God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They said, "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Behold, he smote the rock so that the waters gushed out<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the streams overflowed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Can he give bread also?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Can he provide flesh for his people?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Therefore, the LORD heard this and was angry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus a fire was kindled against Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and anger also came up against Israel,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Because they did not believe in God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not trust in his salvation,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Though he commanded the clouds from above<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and opened the doors of heaven,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And rained down manna upon them to eat<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave them the grain of heaven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Man ate angels' food.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He sent them food to the full.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He also rained flesh upon them as dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and feathered birds as the sand of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />around their habitations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> So they ate and were well filled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he gave them their own desire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> They were not estranged from their desire.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But while their food was yet in their mouths,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The wrath of God came upon them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and slew the fattest of them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> For all this they sinned still<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not believe in his wondrous works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Therefore, he consumed their days in vanity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their years in trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> When he slew them, they sought him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They returned and inquired early after God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> And they remembered that God was their rock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the high God their redeemer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they lied to him with their tongues.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> For their heart was not right with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Many a time he even turned his anger away<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> For he remembered that they were but flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a wind that passes away and does not return.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> How often they provoked him in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and grieved him in the desert!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> They even turned back and tested God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> They did not remember his hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> And had turned their rivers into blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also their floods, so that they could not drink.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> He sent swarms of flies among them which devoured them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also frogs which destroyed them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> He also gave their increase to the ravaging-locust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their labor to the swarming-locust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their sycamore trees with frost.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">48</span> He also gave up their cattle to the hail<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />wrath, indignation, and trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by sending evil angels among them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">50</span> He made a way to his anger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He did not spare their soul from death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">51</span> And smote all the first-born in Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">52</span> But made his own people to go forth like sheep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">53</span> And he led them on safely so that they did not fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">54</span> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">55</span> He also cast out the heathen before them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He divided them an inheritance by line<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">56</span> Yet they tested and provoked the most high God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not keep his testimonies,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">57</span> But turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">58</span> For they provoked him to anger with their high places<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">59</span> When God heard this, he was angry<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and greatly abhorred Israel,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the tent which he placed among men,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">61</span> And delivered his strength into captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">62</span> He also gave over his people to the sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and was angry with his inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">63</span> The fire consumed their young men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their young women were not given to marriage.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their widows made no lamentation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">65</span> Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">66</span> And he smote his enemies backward.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">67</span> Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the mount Zion which he loved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">69</span> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like the earth which he has established forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">70</span> He also chose David his servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and took him from the sheep-folds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">71</span> From following the ewes great with young he brought him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">72</span> Thus he fed them according to the integrity of his heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20078.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 78</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>To comprehend many things within small compass, it is to be observed, that in this psalm there are two leading topics. On the one hand, it is declared how God adopted for himself a Church from the posterity of Abraham, how tenderly and graciously he cherished it, how wonderfully he brought it out of Egypt, and how varied were the blessings which he bestowed upon it. On the other hand, the Jews, who were so much indebted to him for the great blessings which he had conferred upon them, are upbraided for having from time to time perversely and treacherously revolted from so liberal a father; so that his inestimable goodness was clearly manifested, not only in his free adoption of them at first, but also in continuing by the uninterrupted course of his goodness to strive against the rebellion of so perfidious and stiff-necked a people. Moreover, mention is made of the renewal of God's grace, and as it were of a second election which he made when he chose David out of the tribe of Judah to sway the scepter over the kingdom of Israel.</p>
