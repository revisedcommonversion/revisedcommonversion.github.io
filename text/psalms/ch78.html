  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of Asaph.</span>] Give ear, O my people, to my law. Incline your ear to the words of my mouth.</p>

  <p>2 I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,</p>

  <p>3 Which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us.</p>

  <p>4 We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.</p>

  <p>5 For he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children,</p>

  <p>6 So that the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children;</p>

  <p>7 So that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments,</p>

  <p>8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not set their heart aright and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p>

  <p>9 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>

  <p>10 They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to walk in his law,</p>

  <p>11 And forgot his works and his wonders that he had shown them.</p>

  <p>12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>

  <p>13 He divided the sea and caused them to pass through. He made the waters to stand as a heap.</p>

  <p>14 In the day-time he also led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire.</p>

  <p>15 He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>

  <p>16 He also brought streams out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>

  <p>17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>18 And they tested God in their heart by asking food for their desire.</p>

  <p>19 They even spoke against God. They said, "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>

  <p>20 Behold, he smote the rock so that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his people?"</p>

  <p>21 Therefore, the LORD heard this and was angry. Thus a fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also came up against Israel,</p>

  <p>22 Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation,</p>

  <p>23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven,</p>

  <p>24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat and given them of the corn of heaven.</p>

  <p>25 Man ate angels' food. He sent them food to the full.</p>

  <p>26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven. And by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>

  <p>27 He also rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered birds as the sand of the sea.</p>

  <p>28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp around their habitations.</p>

  <p>29 So they ate and were well filled, for he gave them their own desire.</p>

  <p>30 They were not estranged from their desire. But while their food was yet in their mouths,</p>

  <p>31 The wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>

  <p>32 For all this they sinned still and did not believe in his wondrous works.</p>

  <p>33 Therefore, he consumed their days in vanity and their years in trouble.</p>

  <p>34 When he slew them, they sought him. They returned and inquired early after God.</p>

  <p>35 And they remembered that God was their rock and the high God their redeemer.</p>

  <p>36 Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth and they lied to him with their tongues.</p>

  <p>37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</p>

  <p>38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. Many a time he even turned his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

  <p>39 For he remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away and does not return.</p>

  <p>40 How often they provoked him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!</p>

  <p>41 They even turned back and tested God and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>

  <p>42 They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy,</p>

  <p>43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p>

  <p>44 And had turned their rivers into blood, and also their floods, so that they could not drink.</p>

  <p>45 He sent swarms of flies among them which devoured them, and also frogs which destroyed them.</p>

  <p>46 He also gave their increase to the ravaging-locust and their labor to the swarming-locust.</p>

  <p>47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost.</p>

  <p>48 He also gave up their cattle to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>

  <p>49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>

  <p>50 He made a way to his anger. He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p>

  <p>51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham,</p>

  <p>52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>

  <p>53 And he led them on safely so that they did not fear. But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>

  <p>54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>

  <p>55 He also cast out the heathen before them. He divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>

  <p>56 Yet they tested and provoked the most high God and did not keep his testimonies,</p>

  <p>57 But turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>

  <p>58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p>

  <p>59 When God heard this, he was angry and greatly abhorred Israel,</p>

  <p>60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men,</p>

  <p>61 And delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>

  <p>62 He also gave over his people to the sword and was angry with his inheritance.</p>

  <p>63 The fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>

  <p>64 Their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation.</p>

  <p>65 Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep and like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p>

  <p>66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder part. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>

  <p>67 Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>

  <p>68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>

  <p>69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established forever.</p>

  <p>70 He also chose David his servant and took him from the sheep-folds.</p>

  <p>71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritance.</p>

  <p>72 Thus he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>
