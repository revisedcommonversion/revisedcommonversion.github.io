    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> O give thanks to the LORD. Call upon his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make his deeds known among the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Sing to him. Sing psalms to him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Talk of all his wondrous works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Glory in his holy name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the heart of those who seek the LORD rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Seek the LORD and his strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seek his face evermore.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Remember his wonderful works which he has done,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> O you offspring of Abraham his servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you children of Jacob his chosen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He is the LORD our God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His judgments are in all the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He has remembered his covenant forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Which covenant he made with Abraham,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his oath to Isaac,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And confirmed the same to Jacob for a law<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the lot of your inheritance,"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> When they were a few men in number,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even very few, and strangers in it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> When they went from one nation to another,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from one kingdom to another people,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He allowed no man to do them wrong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He even reproved kings for their sakes,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Saying, "Do not touch my anointed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do my prophets no harm."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Moreover, he called for a famine upon the land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He broke the whole staff of bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He sent a man before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even Joseph, who was sold for a servant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> They hurt his feet with fetters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he was laid in iron.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Until the time that his word came to pass,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the word of the LORD tried him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The king sent and released him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He made him lord of his house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and ruler of all his substance,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> To bind his princes at his pleasure<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and teach his elders wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Israel also came into Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And he increased his people greatly<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> He turned their heart to hate his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to deal subtly with his servants.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He sent Moses his servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> They showed his signs among them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> He sent darkness and made it dark,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they did not rebel against his word.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He turned their waters into blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and slew their fish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the chambers of their kings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lice in all their borders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> He gave them hail for rain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and flaming fire in their land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> He also smote their vines and their fig-trees<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and broke the trees of their borders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> He spoke, and the swarming-locusts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and licking-locusts came—and that without number—</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> And ate up all the herbs in their land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> He also smote all the first-born in their land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the chief of all their strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> He also brought them forth with silver and gold.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> He spread a cloud for a covering<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fire to give light in the night.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> The people asked, and he brought quails<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They ran in the dry places like a river.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> For he remembered his holy promise<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Abraham his servant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> And he brought forth his people with joy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his chosen with gladness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> He gave them the lands of the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they inherited the labor of the people,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> So that they might observe his statutes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and keep his laws.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The Psalmist magnifies the singular grace of God displayed in selecting and freely adopting one people from amongst all nations of the world. To show that it was not in word only that he had made a covenant with Abraham and his offspring, God did not cease, after having delivered them from Egypt, to confer upon them innumerable benefits; and his design in this was, that those who had been delivered might on their part faithfully keep his covenant, and devote themselves unfeignedly to his service.</p>
  <p>[v.34] - "swarming-locusts and licking-locusts" - See the note for Joel 1:4.</p>
  <p>[v.41] - Reference, 1st Corinthians 10:4.</p>
