  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.</span>] Give ear to my words, O LORD. Consider my meditation.</p>

  <p>2 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God. For to you I will pray.</p>

  <p>3 My voice you shall hear in the morning, O LORD. In the morning I will direct my prayer to you and will look up.</p>

  <p>4 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with you.</p>

  <p>5 The foolish shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.</p>

  <p>6 You shall destroy those who speak falsehood. The LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>

  <p>7 But as for me, I will come into your house in the multitude of your mercy, and in your fear I will worship toward your holy temple.</p>

  <p>8 Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.</p>

  <p>9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their inward part is wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulcher. They flatter with their tongue.</p>

  <p>10 Destroy them, O God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions. For they have rebelled against you.</p>

  <p>11 But let all those who put their trust in you rejoice. Let them always shout for joy because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.</p>

  <p>12 For you, LORD, will bless the righteous. With favor you will compass him as with a shield.</p>
