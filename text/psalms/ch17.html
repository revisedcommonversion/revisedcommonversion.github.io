  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Prayer of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Hear the right, O LORD. Attend to my cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Give ear to my prayer, which does not go out of feigned lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Let my sentence come forth from your presence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let your eyes behold the things that are equal.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have tried me and shall find nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have kept myself from the paths of the destroyer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Uphold my goings in your paths<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that my footsteps do not slip.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I have called upon you, for you will hear me, O God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incline your ear to me and hear my speech.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Show your wonderful loving-kindness, O you who save by your right hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />those who put their trust in you from those who rise up against them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Keep me as the apple of your eye.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Hide me under the shadow of your wings,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> From the wicked who oppress me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from my deadly enemies who encompass me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They are enclosed in their own fat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They speak proudly with their mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> They have now compassed us in our steps.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Like a lion that is greedy of his prey<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like a young lion lurking in secret places.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Arise, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Disappoint him. Cast him down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> From men who are your hand, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from men of the world who have their portion in this life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whose belly you fill with your hidden treasure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are full of children<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and leave the rest of their substance to their babies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall be satisfied with your likeness when I awake.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20017.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 17</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm contains a mournful complaint against the cruel pride of David's enemies. He protests that he did not deserve to be persecuted with such inhumanity, inasmuch as he had given them no cause for exercising their cruelty against him. At the same time, he beseeches God, as his protector, to put forth his power for his deliverance. The inscription of the psalm does not refer to any particular time, but it is probable that David here complains of Saul and his associates.</p>
