  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>

  <p>2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity,</p>

  <p>3 Who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words,</p>

  <p>4 So that they may shoot in secret at the perfect. Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.</p>

  <p>5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter. They commune of laying snares secretly. They say, "Who will see them?"</p>

  <p>6 They search out iniquities. They accomplish a diligent search. Both the inward thought and the heart of every one of them is deep.</p>

  <p>7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow. Suddenly they shall be wounded.</p>

  <p>8 Thus they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves. All who see them shall flee away.</p>

  <p>9 And all men shall fear and declare the work of God, for they shall wisely consider his work.</p>

  <p>10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD and trust in him, and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20064.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 64</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm expresses the language of complaint and prayer. David, in order that he may incline God to compassionate his case, dwells upon the injustice and cruelty, the intrigues and deceitfulness of his enemies. At the close, his eyes are directed to God, in the anticipation of a joyful deliverance from their hands.</p>
