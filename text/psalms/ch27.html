  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">The LORD is my light and my salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Whom shall I fear?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD is the strength of my life.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Of whom shall I be afraid?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> When the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even my enemies and my foes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />came upon me to eat up my flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they stumbled and fell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Though a host should encamp against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my heart shall not fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though war should rise against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in this I will be confident.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> One thing I have desired of the LORD that I will seek after:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to behold the beauty of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to inquire in his temple.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the secret of his tabernacle he will hide me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will set me up upon a rock.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And now my head shall be lifted above my enemies around me; therefore,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing, I will even sing praises to the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have mercy upon me and answer me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Your face, LORD, I will seek."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Do not hide your face from me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not put your servant away in anger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have been my help.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not leave me, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> When my father and my mother forsake me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD will take me up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Teach me your way, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lead me in a plain path<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of my enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Do not deliver me over to the will of my enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for false witnesses have risen against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who breathe out cruelty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the land of the living.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Wait for the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Wait, I say, for the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20027.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 27</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm, David rehearses the desires and meditations with which he had exercised himself in the midst of his great dangers. The thanksgivings which he mingles with them show that it was composed after his deliverance. It is also probable that he repeats at once the prayers which had exercised his thoughts in his different meditations. Hence it is to be seen here with what invincible fortitude of soul the holy man was endued, that he might overcome the most grievous assaults of his enemies. His wonderful piety shines forth in this: that he wished to live for no other purpose than to serve God, nor could he be turned aside from this purpose by any anxiety or trouble.</p>
