  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] The LORD is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?</p>

  <p>2 When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p>

  <p>3 Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this I will be confident.</p>

  <p>4 One thing I have desired of the LORD that I will seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in his temple.</p>

  <p>5 For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle he will hide me. He will set me up upon a rock.</p>

  <p>6 And now my head shall be lifted above my enemies around me; therefore, I will offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing, I will even sing praises to the LORD.</p>

  <p>7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice, and have mercy upon me and answer me.</p>

  <p>8 When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you, "Your face, LORD, I will seek."</p>

  <p>9 Do not hide your face from me. Do not put your servant away in anger. You have been my help. Do not leave me, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p>

  <p>10 When my father and my mother forsake me, the LORD will take me up.</p>

  <p>11 Teach me your way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies.</p>

  <p>12 Do not deliver me over to the will of my enemies, for false witnesses have risen against me, and those who breathe out cruelty.</p>

  <p>13 I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</p>

  <p>14 Wait for the LORD. Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart. Wait, I say, for the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20027.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 27</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm, David rehearses the desires and meditations with which he had exercised himself in the midst of his great dangers. The thanksgivings which he mingles with them show that it was composed after his deliverance. It is also probable that he repeats at once the prayers which had exercised his thoughts in his different meditations. Hence it is to be seen here with what invincible fortitude of soul the holy man was endued, that he might overcome the most grievous assaults of his enemies. His wonderful piety shines forth in this: that he wished to live for no other purpose than to serve God, nor could he be turned aside from this purpose by any anxiety or trouble.</p>
