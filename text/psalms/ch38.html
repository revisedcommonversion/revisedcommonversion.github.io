  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David: to bring to remembrance.</span>] O LORD, do not rebuke me in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.</p>

  <p>2 For your arrows stick firmly in me and your hand falls heavy upon me.</p>

  <p>3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your anger, neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</p>

  <p>4 For my iniquities have gone over my head. As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>

  <p>5 My wounds are offensive and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</p>

  <p>6 I am troubled. I am bowed down greatly. I go mourning all the day long.</p>

  <p>7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease, and there is no soundness in my flesh.</p>

  <p>8 I am feeble and grievously broken. I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>

  <p>9 Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning is not hid from you.</p>

  <p>10 My heart pants. My strength fails me. As for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me.</p>

  <p>11 My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my affliction, and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>

  <p>12 Those who also seek after my life lay snares for me. And those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things and plot deceits all the day long.</p>

  <p>13 But I, as a deaf man, did not hear. And I was as a mute man who does not open his mouth.</p>

  <p>14 Thus I was as a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</p>

  <p>15 For in you, O LORD, I hope. You will hear, O Lord my God.</p>

  <p>16 For I said, "Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me. When my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me."</p>

  <p>17 For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually before me.</p>

  <p>18 For I will declare my iniquity. I will be sorry for my sin.</p>

  <p>19 But my enemies are lively and they are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>

  <p>20 Those who also render evil for good are my adversaries because I follow the thing that is good.</p>

  <p>21 Do not forsake me, O LORD. O my God, do not be far from me.</p>

  <p>22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>
