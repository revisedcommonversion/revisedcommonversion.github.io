  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">The king shall rejoice in your strength, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And in your salvation how greatly he shall rejoice!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> You have given him his heart's desire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not withheld the request of his lips.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For you have met him with the blessings of goodness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have set a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He asked life of you, and you gave it to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even length of days forever and ever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> His glory is great in your salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Honor and majesty you have laid upon him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For you have made him most blessed forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have made him exceedingly glad with your countenance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For the king trusts in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Your hand shall find out all your enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your right hand shall find out those who hate you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of your anger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fire shall devour them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> You shall destroy their fruit from the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their offspring from among the children of men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For they intended evil against you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They conceived a mischievous device which they are not able to perform.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, you shall make them turn their back<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you make ready your arrows upon your strings against their face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Be exalted, LORD, in your own strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we will sing and praise your power.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20021.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 21</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm contains a public and solemn thanksgiving for the prosperous and happy condition of the king. Its subject is almost the same with that of the preceding. In the former there was set forth a common form of prayer, which was designed to excite in the whole people earnest concern for the preservation of their head. In this it is shown that the safety and prosperity of the king ought to produce public and general rejoicing through the whole realm, inasmuch as God by this means intended to preserve the whole body in safety. But, above all, it was the design of the Holy Spirit here to direct the minds of the faithful to Christ, who was the end and perfection of this kingdom, and to teach them that they could not be saved except under the head which God himself had appointed over them.</p>
