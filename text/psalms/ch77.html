  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I cried to God with my voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My hand was stretched out in the night and did not cease.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My soul refused to be comforted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I remembered God and was troubled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> You hold my eyes waking.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I have considered the days of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the years of ancient times.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> I call to remembrance my song in the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I commune with my own heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my spirit made diligent search.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Will the Lord cast off forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And will he no longer be favorable?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Is his mercy wholly gone forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Does his promise fail forevermore?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Has God forgotten to be gracious?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And I said, "This is my infirmity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I will remember the works of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely I will remember your wonders of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I will meditate also of all your work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and talk of your doings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is so great a God as our God?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You are the God who does wonders.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have declared your strength among the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> You have with your arm redeemed your people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The waters saw you, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the waters saw you. They were afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The depths also were disturbed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The clouds poured out water.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The skies sent out a sound.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your arrows also went abroad.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The voice of your thunder was in the heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The lightnings lightened the world.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The earth trembled and shook.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Your way is in the sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your paths in the great waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your footsteps are not known.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You led your people like a flock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20077.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 77</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Whoever was the penman of this psalm, the Holy Spirit seems, by his mouth, to have dictated a common form of prayer for the Church in her afflictions, that even under the most cruel persecutions the faithful might not fail to address their prayers to heaven. It is not the private grief of some particular individual which is here expressed, but the lamentations and groanings of the chosen people. The faithful celebrate the deliverance which had been once wrought for them, and which was a testimony of God's everlasting grace, to animate and strengthen themselves to engage in the exercise of prayer with the greater earnestness.</p>
