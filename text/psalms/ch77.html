  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician, to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.</span>] I cried to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.</p>

  <p>2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord. My hand was stretched out in the night and did not cease. My soul refused to be comforted.</p>

  <p>3 I remembered God and was troubled. I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>4 You hold my eyes waking. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>

  <p>5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>

  <p>6 I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with my own heart, and my spirit made diligent search.</p>

  <p>7 Will the Lord cast off forever? And will he no longer be favorable?</p>

  <p>8 Is his mercy wholly gone forever? Does his promise fail forevermore?</p>

  <p>9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>10 And I said, "This is my infirmity, but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High."</p>

  <p>11 I will remember the works of the LORD. Surely I will remember your wonders of old.</p>

  <p>12 I will meditate also of all your work and talk of your doings.</p>

  <p>13 Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary. Who is so great a God as our God?</p>

  <p>14 You are the God who does wonders. You have declared your strength among the people.</p>

  <p>15 You have with your arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>16 The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you. They were afraid. The depths also were disturbed.</p>

  <p>17 The clouds poured out water. The skies sent out a sound. Your arrows also went abroad.</p>

  <p>18 The voice of your thunder was in the heaven. The lightnings lightened the world. The earth trembled and shook.</p>

  <p>19 Your way is in the sea and your paths in the great waters, and your footsteps are not known.</p>

  <p>20 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
