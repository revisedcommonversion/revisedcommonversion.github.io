  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">In you, O LORD, I put my trust.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let me never be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deliver me in your righteousness.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me speedily.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Be my strong rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a house of defense to save me.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For you are my rock and my fortress;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, for your name's sake lead me and guide me.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Pull me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are my strength.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Into your hand I commit my spirit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I have hated those who regard lying vanities,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I trust in the LORD.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you have considered my trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have known my soul in adversities,</p>

    <p>8&emsp; And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have set my foot in a large room.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My eye is consumed with grief, even my soul and my belly.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For my life is spent with grief<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my years with sighing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My strength fails because of my iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my bones are consumed.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;I was a reproach among all my enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but especially among my neighbors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a fear to my acquaintances.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Those who saw me outside fled from me.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am like a broken vessel.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;For I have heard the slander of many.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Fear was on every side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />While they took counsel together against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they devised to take away my life.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;But I trusted in you, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I said, "You are my God."</p>

    <p>15&emsp;My times are in your hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Make your face to shine upon your servant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Save me for your mercies' sake.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Do not let me be ashamed, O LORD, for I have called upon you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the wicked be ashamed. Let them be silent in the grave.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Let the lying lips be put to silence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which speak grievous things proudly<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Oh how great your goodness is,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you have laid up for those who fear you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you have wrought for those who trust in you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before the sons of men!</p>

    <p>20&emsp;You shall hide them in the secret of your presence from the pride of man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Blessed be the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he has shown me his wonderful kindness in a strong city.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;For I said in my haste,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I am cut off from before your eyes."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my supplications<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I cried to you.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;O love the LORD, all his saints,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD preserves the faithful<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fully recompenses the proud doer.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all you who hope in the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, having been delivered from some great danger, or rather from many dangers, first relates the prayers which he had offered up to God amidst the terrors of death. He then subjoins his thanksgiving, which is no ordinary one; for he celebrates his deliverance at great length, and exhorts all the saints to be of good hope, as they had in him a most excellent and memorable example of God's goodness.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Quoted in Luke 23:46.</p>
