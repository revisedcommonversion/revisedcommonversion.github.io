  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">In you, O LORD, I put my trust. <br />Let me never be ashamed. <br />Deliver me in your righteousness.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Bow down your ear to me. Deliver me speedily. <br />Be my strong rock, <br />a house of defense to save me.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For you are my rock and my fortress; <br />therefore, for your name's sake lead me and guide me.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Pull me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, <br />for you are my strength.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Into your hand I commit my spirit. <br />You have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; I have hated those who regard lying vanities, <br />but I trust in the LORD.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy, <br />for you have considered my trouble. <br />You have known my soul in adversities,</p>

    <p>8&emsp; And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. <br />You have set my foot in a large room.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble. <br />My eye is consumed with grief, even my soul and my belly.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For my life is spent with grief <br />and my years with sighing. <br />My strength fails because of my iniquity <br />and my bones are consumed.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;I was a reproach among all my enemies, <br />but especially among my neighbors, <br />and a fear to my acquaintances. <br />Those who saw me outside fled from me.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind. <br />I am like a broken vessel.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;For I have heard the slander of many. <br />Fear was on every side. <br />While they took counsel together against me, <br />they devised to take away my life.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;But I trusted in you, O LORD. <br />I said, "You are my God."</p>

    <p>15&emsp;My times are in your hand. <br />Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those who persecute me.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Make your face to shine upon your servant. <br />Save me for your mercies' sake.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Do not let me be ashamed, O LORD, for I have called upon you. <br />Let the wicked be ashamed. Let them be silent in the grave.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Let the lying lips be put to silence, <br />which speak grievous things proudly <br />and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Oh how great your goodness is, <br />which you have laid up for those who fear you, <br />which you have wrought for those who trust in you <br />before the sons of men!</p>

    <p>20&emsp;You shall hide them in the secret of your presence from the pride of man. <br />You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Blessed be the LORD, <br />for he has shown me his wonderful kindness in a strong city.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;For I said in my haste, <br />"I am cut off from before your eyes." <br />Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my supplications <br />when I cried to you.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;O love the LORD, all his saints, <br />for the LORD preserves the faithful <br />and fully recompenses the proud doer.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Be of good courage, and he will strengthen your heart, <br />all you who hope in the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, having been delivered from some great danger, or rather from many dangers, first relates the prayers which he had offered up to God amidst the terrors of death. He then subjoins his thanksgiving, which is no ordinary one; for he celebrates his deliverance at great length, and exhorts all the saints to be of good hope, as they had in him a most excellent and memorable example of God's goodness.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Quoted in Luke 23:46.</p>
