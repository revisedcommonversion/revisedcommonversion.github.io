  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.</p>

  <p>2 Give to the LORD the glory due to his name. Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>

  <p>3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters. The God of glory thunders. The LORD is upon many waters.</p>

  <p>4 The voice of the LORD is powerful. The voice of the LORD is full of majesty.</p>

  <p>5 The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars. The LORD even breaks the cedars of Lebanon.</p>

  <p>6 He makes them also to skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild ox.</p>

  <p>7 The voice of the LORD divides the flames of fire.</p>

  <p>8 The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness. The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>

  <p>9 The voice of the LORD makes the hinds to calve and makes the forests bare. And in his temple everyone speaks of his glory.</p>

  <p>10 The LORD sits upon the flood. The LORD even sits king forever.</p>

  <p>11 The LORD will give strength to his people. The LORD will bless his people with peace.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20029.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 29</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, that he may humble all men before God, from the highest to the lowest, celebrates his terrible power in the various wonders of nature, which he affirms are not less fitted to arouse us to give glory to God, than if he were to assert his empire and majesty with his own voice. After he has struck fear into the proud, who are reluctant to yield, and addressed an exhortation to them accompanied by a gentle reproof, he sweetly invites the faithful voluntarily to fear the Lord.</p>
