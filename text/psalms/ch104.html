    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Bless the LORD, O my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD my God, you are very great.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are clothed with honor and majesty,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Who covers himself with light as with a garment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who makes the clouds his chariot,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who walks upon the wings of the wind,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Who makes his angels spirits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his ministers a flaming fire,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Who laid the foundations of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it should not be moved forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You covered it with the deep as with a garment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The waters stood above the mountains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> At your rebuke they fled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At the voice of your thunder they hastened away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They go up by the mountains. They go down by the valleys<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the place which you have founded for them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You have set a bound that they may not pass over<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they do not turn back to cover the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He sends the springs into the valleys,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which run among the hills.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> They give drink to every beast of the field.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> By them the birds of the heaven shall have their habitation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which sing among the branches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He waters the hills from his chambers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He causes the grass to grow for the livestock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the herb for the service of man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may bring forth food out of the earth:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Wine that rejoices the heart of man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />oil to cause his face to shine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bread which strengthens man's heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The trees of the LORD are full of sap,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> There the birds make their nests.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rocks for the conies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He appoints the moon for seasons.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sun knows his going down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You make darkness, and it is night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The young lions roar after their prey<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and seek their food from God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The sun rises, and they collect<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay themselves down in their dens.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Man goes forth to his work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to his labor until the evening.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> O LORD, how manifold your works are!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In wisdom you have made them all.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The earth is full of your riches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Thus is this great and wide sea<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which are moving things innumerable,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both small and great beasts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> There go the ships.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is that leviathan which you have made to play therein.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> These all wait upon you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may give them their food in due season.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> That which you give them, they gather.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You open your hand, and they are filled with good.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> You hide your face, and they are troubled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You take away their breath, and they die<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and return to their dust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> You send forth your Spirit, and they are created.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you renew the face of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The glory of the LORD shall endure forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> He looks at the earth, and it trembles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He touches the hills, and they smoke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> I will sing to the LORD as long as I live.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> My meditation of him shall be sweet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will be glad in the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the wicked be no more.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bless the LORD, O my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20104.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 104</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as it neither treats of the special benefits which God bestows upon his Church, nor lifts us up to the hope of the heavenly life, but by presenting to us a lively image of his wisdom, power, and goodness in the creation of the world, and in the order of nature, encourages us to praise him for the manifestation he has made of himself as a father to us in this frail and perishable life.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:7.</p>
  <p>[v.25] - "moving things" - That is, living creatures that move, creep, or glide through the water.</p>
