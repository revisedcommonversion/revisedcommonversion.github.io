  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great. You are clothed with honor and majesty,</p>

  <p>2 Who covers himself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,</p>

  <p>3 Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,</p>

  <p>4 Who makes his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire,</p>

  <p>5 Who laid the foundations of the earth so that it should not be moved forever.</p>

  <p>6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment. The waters stood above the mountains.</p>

  <p>7 At your rebuke they fled. At the voice of your thunder they hastened away.</p>

  <p>8 They go up by the mountains. They go down by the valleys to the place which you have founded for them.</p>

  <p>9 You have set a bound that they may not pass over so that they do not turn back to cover the earth.</p>

  <p>10 He sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</p>

  <p>11 They give drink to every beast of the field. The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>

  <p>12 By them the birds of the heaven shall have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</p>

  <p>13 He waters the hills from his chambers. The earth is satisfied with the fruit of your works.</p>

  <p>14 He causes the grass to grow for the cattle and the herb for the service of man so that he may bring forth food out of the earth,</p>

  <p>15 And wine that rejoices the heart of man, oil to cause his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart.</p>

  <p>16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap, the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted.</p>

  <p>17 There the birds make their nests. As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.</p>

  <p>18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies.</p>

  <p>19 He appoints the moon for seasons. The sun knows his going down.</p>

  <p>20 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.</p>

  <p>21 The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.</p>

  <p>22 The sun rises, and they collect and lay themselves down in their dens.</p>

  <p>23 Man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening.</p>

  <p>24 O LORD, how manifold your works are! In wisdom you have made them all. The earth is full of your riches.</p>

  <p>25 Thus is this great and wide sea in which are moving things innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>

  <p>26 There go the ships. There is that leviathan which you have made to play therein.</p>

  <p>27 These all wait upon you so that you may give them their food in due season.</p>

  <p>28 That which you give them, they gather. You open your hand, and they are filled with good.</p>

  <p>29 You hide your face, and they are troubled. You take away their breath, and they die and return to their dust.</p>

  <p>30 You send forth your Spirit, and they are created. And you renew the face of the earth.</p>

  <p>31 The glory of the LORD shall endure forever. The LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>

  <p>32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles. He touches the hills, and they smoke.</p>

  <p>33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>

  <p>34 My meditation of him shall be sweet. I will be glad in the LORD.</p>

  <p>35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20104.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 104</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as it neither treats of the special benefits which God bestows upon his Church, nor lifts us up to the hope of the heavenly life, but by presenting to us a lively image of his wisdom, power, and goodness in the creation of the world, and in the order of nature, encourages us to praise him for the manifestation he has made of himself as a father to us in this frail and perishable life.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Quoted in Hebrews 1:7.</p>
  <p>[v.25] - "moving things" - That is, living creatures that move, creep, or glide through the water.</p>
