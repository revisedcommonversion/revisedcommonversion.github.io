  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongs, O God, to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.</p>

  <p>2 Lift up yourself, judge of the earth. Render a reward to the proud.</p>

  <p>3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>

  <p>4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things, and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>

  <p>5 They break your people in pieces, O LORD, and afflict your heritage.</p>

  <p>6 They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless.</p>

  <p>7 Yet they say, "The LORD will not see, neither will the God of Jacob regard it."</p>

  <p>8 Understand, you brutish among the people. And you fools, when will you be wise?</p>

  <p>9 He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>

  <p>10 He who chastises the heathen, shall he not correct? He who teaches man knowledge, shall he not know?</p>

  <p>11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</p>

  <p>12 Blessed is the man whom you chasten, O LORD, and teach him out of your law,</p>

  <p>13 So that you may give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit is dug for the wicked.</p>

  <p>14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>

  <p>15 But judgment shall return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>

  <p>16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>

  <p>17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul would have almost dwelt in silence.</p>

  <p>18 When I said, "My foot slips," your mercy, O LORD, held me up.</p>

  <p>19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.</p>

  <p>20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with you, which frames mischief by a law?</p>

  <p>21 They assemble themselves against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood.</p>

  <p>22 But the LORD is my defense, and my God is the rock of my refuge.</p>

  <p>23 And he will bring upon them their own iniquity and will cut them off in their own wickedness. Indeed, the LORD our God will cut them off.</p>
