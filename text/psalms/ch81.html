  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph.</span>] Sing aloud to God our strength. Make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.</p>

  <p>2 Take a psalm and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>

  <p>3 Blow the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>

  <p>4 For this was a statute for Israel and a law of the God of Jacob.</p>

  <p>5 He ordained this in Joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt. I heard a language that I did not understand:</p>

  <p>6 "I removed his shoulder from the burden. His hands were delivered from the pots.</p>

  <p>7 You called in trouble, and I delivered you. I answered you in the secret place of thunder. I proved you at the waters of Meribah." [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>8 "Hear, O my people, and I will testify to you, O Israel, if you would listen to me.</p>

  <p>9 There shall no strange god be in you, neither shall you worship any strange god.</p>

  <p>10 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>

  <p>11 But my people would not listen to my voice, and Israel would not obey me.</p>

  <p>12 So I gave them up to the lust of their hearts, and they walked in their own counsels.</p>

  <p>13 O that my people had listened to me and Israel had walked in my ways!</p>

  <p>14 I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries.</p>

  <p>15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves to him, and their time should have endured forever.</p>

  <p>16 He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat. And with honey out of the rock I would satisfy you."</p>
