  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm or Song of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Let God arise. Let his enemies be scattered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let those who also hate him flee before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As wax melts before the fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> But let the righteous be glad.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them rejoice before God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Sing to God, sing praises to his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Extol him who rides upon the heavens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by his name, YAH,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rejoice before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is God in his holy habitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> God sets the solitary in families.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He brings out those who are bound with chains.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> O God, when you went forth before your people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you marched through the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The earth shook,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the heavens also dropped at the presence of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even Sinai itself was moved<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You, O God, sent a plentiful rain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by which you confirmed your inheritance when it was weary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Your congregation has dwelt therein.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You, O God, have prepared your goodness for the poor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The Lord gave the word.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The company of those who published it was great.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Kings of armies fled apace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And she who waited at home divided the plunder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Though you have lain among the sheep-folds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the wings of a dove are covered with silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her feathers with yellow gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> When the Almighty scattered kings in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it was white as snow in Salmon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The hill of God is like the hill of Bashan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a high hill like the hill of Bashan.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Why do you leap, you lofty hills?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This is the hill which God desires to dwell in.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, the LORD will dwell in it forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The chariots of God are twenty thousand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even thousands of angels.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Lord is among them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sinai is in the holy place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> You have ascended on high.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have led captivity captive.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have received gifts among men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even among the rebellious also,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the LORD God might dwell with them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Blessed be the Lord who daily loads us with benefits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the God of our salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He who is our God is the God of salvation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the issues from death belong to GOD the Lord.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> But God will wound the head of his enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in his trespasses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The Lord said, "I will bring back from Bashan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will bring my people back from the depths of the sea,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> So that your foot may be dipped<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the blood of your enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the tongue of your dogs in the same."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They have seen your goings, O God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The singers went before.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The players on instruments followed after.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Among them were the young women playing with tambourines.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Bless God in the congregations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> There is the youngest, Benjamin, with their ruler,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the princes of Judah and their counsel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Your God has commanded your strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Strengthen, O God, that which you have wrought for us.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />kings shall bring presents to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until each submits himself with pieces of silver.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Scatter the people who delight in war.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Princes shall come out of Egypt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cush shall soon stretch out her hands to God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O sing praises to the Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> To him who rides upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, he sends out his voice—a mighty voice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Ascribe strength to God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His excellence is over Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his strength is in the clouds.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> O God, you are awesome out of your holy places.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The God of Israel is he who gives strength and power to his people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed be God.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20068.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 68</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this psalm it was David's design to celebrate the victories which, through the blessing of God, he had gained over his enemies; but, in the opening verses, he commends the power and goodness of God generally, as seen in the government of the world at large. From this he passes to the consideration of what God had done in redeeming his chosen people, and of the continued proofs of fatherly care which he had manifested to the posterity of Abraham. He then proceeds to the subject which he had more particularly in view, prosecuting it at length, and in terms of the most exalted description; praising the signal display of Divine power which he, and the whole nation with him, had experienced. Now that he had been made king, he infers that the Church was brought to a settled condition, and that God, who seemed to have departed, would now at length erect his throne, as it were, in the midst of it, and reign. In this it would evidently appear, that he designed, typically, to represent the glory of God afterwards to be manifested in Christ.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - Quoted in Ephesians 4:8.</p>
