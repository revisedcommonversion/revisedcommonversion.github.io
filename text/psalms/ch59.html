  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. Al-taschith. Michtam of David: when Saul sent and they watched the house to kill him.</span>] Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. Defend me from those who rise up against me.</p>

  <p>2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men.</p>

  <p>3 For behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty are gathered against me, not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</p>

  <p>4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault. Awake to help me, and behold.</p>

  <p>5 You therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen. Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>6 They return at evening. They make a noise like a dog and go throughout the city.</p>

  <p>7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, for they say, "Who hears?"</p>

  <p>8 But you, O LORD, shall laugh at them. You shall have all the heathen in derision.</p>

  <p>9 Because of his strength I will wait upon you, for God is my defense.</p>

  <p>10 As for my God, his mercy shall go before me. God will let me see my desire upon my enemies.</p>

  <p>11 Do not slay them, lest my people forget. Scatter them by your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>

  <p>12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride, and also for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>

  <p>13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they may not be. And let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>14 And at evening let them return. And let them make a noise like a dog and go throughout the city.</p>

  <p>15 Let them wander up and down for food and wait all night if they are not satisfied.</p>

  <p>16 But I will sing of your power. I will even sing aloud of your mercy in the morning, for you have been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>

  <p>17 To you, O my strength, I will sing, for God is my defense and the God of my mercy.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20059.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 59</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The title, which immediately follows, informs us upon what occasion this psalm was written, which bears a considerable resemblance to the preceding. He begins by insisting upon the injustice of that cruel hostility which his enemies showed to him, and which he had done nothing to deserve. His complaint is followed up by prayer to God for help; and afterwards, as his hopes revive in the exercise of devout meditation, he proceeds to prophesy their calamitous destruction. At the close, he engages to preserve a grateful remembrance of his deliverance, and to praise the goodness of God.</p>
