  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. Al-taschith. Michtam of David: when Saul sent and they watched the house to kill him.</span>] Deliver me from my enemies, O my God. Defend me from those who rise up against me.</p>

  <p>2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men.</p>

  <p>3 For behold, they lie in wait for my soul. The mighty are gathered against me, not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</p>

  <p>4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault. Awake to help me, and behold.</p>

  <p>5 You therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen. Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>6 They return at evening. They make a noise like a dog and go about the city.</p>

  <p>7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth. Swords are in their lips, for they say, "Who hears?"</p>

  <p>8 But you, O LORD, shall laugh at them. You shall have all the heathen in derision.</p>

  <p>9 Because of his strength I will wait upon you, for God is my defense.</p>

  <p>10 The God of my mercy will succor me. God will let me see my desire upon my enemies.</p>

  <p>11 Do not slay them, lest my people forget. Scatter them by your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>

  <p>12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride, and also for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>

  <p>13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they may not be. And let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>14 And at evening let them return. And let them make a noise like a dog and go about the city.</p>

  <p>15 Let them wander up and down for food and grudge if they are not satisfied.</p>

  <p>16 But I will sing of your power. I will even sing aloud of your mercy in the morning, for you have been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>

  <p>17 To you, O my strength, I will sing, for God is my defense and the God of my mercy.</p>
