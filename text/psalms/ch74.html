  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of Asaph.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">O God, why have you cast us off forever?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Remember your congregation which you have purchased of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the rod of your inheritance which you have redeemed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />this mount Zion in which you have dwelt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Lift up your feet to the perpetual desolations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even all that the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Your enemies roar in the midst of your congregations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They set up their ensigns for signs.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the thick trees.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> But now they break down its carved work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at once with axes and hammers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They have cast fire into your sanctuary.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have defiled by casting down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the dwelling-place of your name to the ground.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They said in their hearts, "Let us destroy them together."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> We do not see our signs.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no longer any prophet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is there among us any who knows how long.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Why do you withdraw your hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even your right hand? Pluck it out of your bosom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For God is my King of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You divided the sea by your strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You broke the head of leviathan in pieces<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave him to be food for the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> You cleaved the fountain and the flood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You dried up mighty rivers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The day is yours, the night also is yours.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have prepared the light and the sun.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> You have set all the borders of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have made summer and winter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Remember this: the enemy has reproached, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the foolish people have blasphemed your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> O do not deliver the soul of your turtle-dove to the multitude of the wicked.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not forget the congregation of your poor forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Have respect to the covenant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> O do not let the oppressed return ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the poor and needy praise your name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Arise, O God, plead your own cause.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Remember how the foolish man reproaches you daily.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Do not forget the voice of your enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The tumult of those who rise against you increases continually.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20074.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 74</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The people of God in this psalm bewail the desolate condition of the Church, which was such that the very name of Israel was almost annihilated. It appears from their humble supplications that they impute to their own sins all the calamities which they endured; but at the same time they lay before God his own covenant by which he adopted the race of Abraham as his peculiar people. Afterwards they call to remembrance how mightily and gloriously he had in the days of old displayed his power in delivering his Church. Encouraging themselves from this consideration, they beseech Him that he would at length come to their aid, and remedy a state of matters so deplorable and desperate.</p>
