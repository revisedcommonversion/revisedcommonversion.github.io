  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of Asaph.</span>] O God, why have you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?</p>

  <p>2 Remember your congregation which you have purchased of old, the rod of your inheritance which you have redeemed, this mount Zion in which you have dwelt.</p>

  <p>3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual desolations, even all that the enemy has done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>

  <p>4 Your enemies roar in the midst of your congregations. They set up their ensigns for signs.</p>

  <p>5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>

  <p>6 But now they break down its carved work at once with axes and hammers.</p>

  <p>7 They have cast fire into your sanctuary. They have defiled by casting down the dwelling-place of your name to the ground.</p>

  <p>8 They said in their hearts, "Let us destroy them together." They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>

  <p>9 We do not see our signs. There is no longer any prophet, neither is there among us any who knows how long.</p>

  <p>10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</p>

  <p>11 Why do you withdraw your hand, even your right hand? Pluck it out of your bosom.</p>

  <p>12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>

  <p>13 You divided the sea by your strength. You broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

  <p>14 You broke the head of leviathan in pieces and gave him to be food for the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>

  <p>15 You cleaved the fountain and the flood. You dried up mighty rivers.</p>

  <p>16 The day is yours, the night also is yours. You have prepared the light and the sun.</p>

  <p>17 You have set all the borders of the earth. You have made summer and winter.</p>

  <p>18 Remember this: the enemy has reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed your name.</p>

  <p>19 O do not deliver the soul of your turtle-dove to the multitude of the wicked. Do not forget the congregation of your poor forever.</p>

  <p>20 Have respect to the covenant, for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>

  <p>21 O do not let the oppressed return ashamed. Let the poor and needy praise your name.</p>

  <p>22 Arise, O God, plead your own cause. Remember how the foolish man reproaches you daily.</p>

  <p>23 Do not forget the voice of your enemies. The tumult of those who rise against you increases continually.</p>
