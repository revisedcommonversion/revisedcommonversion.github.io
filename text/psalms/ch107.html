    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And gathered them out of the lands<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the east, from the west,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the north, and from the south.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They found no city to dwell in.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Hungry and thirsty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their soul fainted in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And he led them forth by the right way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For he satisfies the longing soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fills the hungry soul with goodness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> There are those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />being bound in affliction and iron,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Because they rebelled against the words of God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and despised the counsel of the Most High.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Therefore, he brought down their heart with labor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They fell down, and there was no one to help.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and broke their bonds apart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For he has broken the gates of brass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cut the bars of iron apart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Fools, because of their transgression<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Their soul abhors all manner of food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they draw near to the gates of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he saves them out of their distresses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He sent his word and healed them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and delivered them from their destructions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Those who go down to the sea in ships,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who do business on great waters,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> These see the works of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his wonders in the deep.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> For he commands and raises the stormy wind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which lifts up its waves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> They mount up to the heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They go down again to the depths.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are at their wit's end.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he brings them out of their distresses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He makes the storm a calm<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the waves of the sea are still.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Then they are glad because they are quiet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus he brings them to their desired haven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> He turns rivers into a wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the water-springs into dry ground,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> And a fruitful land into barrenness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> He turns the wilderness into a standing water<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dry ground into water-springs.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> And there he makes the hungry to dwell<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may prepare a city for habitation,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> And sow the fields and plant vineyards,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which may yield fruits of increase.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> He also blesses them so that they are multiplied greatly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not allow their cattle to decrease.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> Again, they are diminished and brought low<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> He pours contempt upon princes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> Yet he sets the poor on high from affliction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and increases their families like a flock.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> The righteous shall see it and rejoice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> Whoever is wise and will observe these things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20107.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 107</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The Psalmist teaches us, in the first place, that human affairs are not regulated by the fickle and uncertain wheel of fortune, but that we must observe the judgments of God in the different vicissitudes which occur in the world, and which men imagine happen by chance. Consequently, adversity and all the ills which mankind endure, as shipwrecks, famines, banishments, diseases, and disasters in war, are to be regarded as so many tokens of God's displeasure, by which he summons them, on account of their sins, before his judicial throne. But prosperity, and the happy issue of events, ought also to be attributed to his grace, in order that he may always receive the praise which he deserves, that of being a merciful Father, and an impartial Judge. About the close of the psalm, he inveighs against those ungodly men who will not acknowledge God's hand, amid such palpable demonstrations of his providence.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in Luke 1:53.</p>
