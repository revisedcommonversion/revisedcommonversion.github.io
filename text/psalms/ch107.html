  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. For his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</p>

  <p>3 And gathered them out of the lands from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>

  <p>4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way. They found no city to dwell in.</p>

  <p>5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>

  <p>6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

  <p>7 And he led them forth by the right way so that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>

  <p>8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

  <p>9 For he satisfies the longing soul and fills the hungry soul with goodness.</p>

  <p>10 There are those who sit in darkness and in the shades of death, being bound in affliction and iron,</p>

  <p>11 Because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High.</p>

  <p>12 Therefore, he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was no one to help.</p>

  <p>13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>

  <p>14 He brought them out of darkness and the shades of death and broke their bonds apart.</p>

  <p>15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

  <p>16 For he has broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron apart.</p>

  <p>17 Fools, because of their transgression and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>

  <p>18 Their soul abhors all manner of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.</p>

  <p>19 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, he saves them out of their distresses.</p>

  <p>20 He sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.</p>

  <p>21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

  <p>22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>

  <p>23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters,</p>

  <p>24 These see the works of the LORD and his wonders in the deep.</p>

  <p>25 For he commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.</p>

  <p>26 They mount up to the heaven. They go down again to the depths. Their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>

  <p>27 They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man. They are at their wit's end.</p>

  <p>28 Then they cry to the LORD in their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.</p>

  <p>29 He makes the storm a calm so that the waves of the sea are still.</p>

  <p>30 Then they are glad because they are quiet. Thus he brings them to their desired haven.</p>

  <p>31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>

  <p>32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>

  <p>33 He turns rivers into a wilderness, the water-springs into dry ground,</p>

  <p>34 And a fruitful land into barrenness because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</p>

  <p>35 He turns the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into water-springs.</p>

  <p>36 And there he makes the hungry to dwell so that they may prepare a city for habitation,</p>

  <p>37 And sow the fields and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>

  <p>38 He also blesses them so that they are multiplied greatly. He does not allow their cattle to decrease.</p>

  <p>39 Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>

  <p>40 He pours contempt upon princes and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way.</p>

  <p>41 Yet he sets the poor on high from affliction and increases their families like a flock.</p>

  <p>42 The righteous shall see it and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>

  <p>43 Whoever is wise and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the LORD.</p>
