  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>] The earth is the LORD'S, and the fullness thereof, the world, and those who dwell therein.</p>

  <p>2 For he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.</p>

  <p>3 Who shall ascend upon the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place?</p>

  <p>4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</p>

  <p>5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>

  <p>6 This is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, O Jacob. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>7 Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.</p>

  <p>8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle.</p>

  <p>9 Lift up your heads, O gates, even lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.</p>

  <p>10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>As God stands related to all mankind as their Creator and Governor, David, from this consideration, magnifies the special favor which God manifested towards the children of Abraham, in choosing them to be his peculiar people, in preference to the rest of mankind, and in erecting his sanctuary as his house that he might dwell among them. He shows, at the same time, that although the sanctuary was open to all the Jews, God was not near to all of them, but only to those who feared and served him in sincerity, and who had cleansed themselves from the pollutions of the world, in order to devote themselves to holiness and righteousness. Moreover, as the grace of God was more clearly manifested after the temple was built, he celebrates that grace in a strain of splendid poetry, to encourage true believers with the more alacrity to persevere in the exercise of serving and honoring him.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - Quoted in 1st Corinthians 10:26, 28. Reference, Psalm 50:12.</p>
