  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">ALEPH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">א</span>] Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.</p>

  <p>2 Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with the whole heart.</p>

  <p>3 They also do no iniquity. They walk in his ways.</p>

  <p>4 You have commanded us to keep your precepts diligently.</p>

  <p>5 O that my ways were directed to keep your statutes!</p>

  <p>6 Then I shall not be ashamed when I have respect for all your commandments.</p>

  <p>7 I will praise you with uprightness of heart when I have learned your righteous judgments.</p>

  <p>8 I will keep your statutes. O do not forsake me utterly.</p>

  <p>9 [<span class="it">BETH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ב</span>] How shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed to it, according to your word.</p>

  <p>10 With my whole heart I have sought you. O do not let me wander from your commandments.</p>

  <p>11 I have hid your word in my heart so that I might not sin against you.</p>

  <p>12 Blessed are you, O LORD. Teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>13 With my lips I have declared all the judgments of your mouth.</p>

  <p>14 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much as in all riches.</p>

  <p>15 I will meditate in your precepts and have respect for your ways.</p>

  <p>16 I will delight myself in your statutes. I will not forget your word.</p>

  <p>17 [<span class="it">GIMEL</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ג</span>] Deal bountifully with your servant so that I may live and keep your word.</p>

  <p>18 Open my eyes so that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.</p>

  <p>19 I am a stranger in the earth. Do not hide your commandments from me.</p>

  <p>20 My soul breaks for the longing that it has to your judgments at all times.</p>

  <p>21 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who err from your commandments.</p>

  <p>22 Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies.</p>

  <p>23 Princes also sat and spoke against me, but your servant meditated in your statutes.</p>

  <p>24 Your testimonies are also my delight and my counselors.</p>

  <p>25 [<span class="it">DALETH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ד</span>] My soul cleaves to the dust. Revive me according to your word.</p>

  <p>26 I have declared my ways, and you heard me. Teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>27 Make me to understand the way of your precepts, and I shall talk of your wondrous works.</p>

  <p>28 My soul melts for heaviness. Strengthen me according to your word.</p>

  <p>29 Remove from me the way of lying and grant me your law graciously.</p>

  <p>30 I have chosen the way of truth. Your judgments I have laid before me.</p>

  <p>31 I have adhered to your testimonies. O LORD, do not put me to shame.</p>

  <p>32 I will run the way of your commandments when you enlarge my heart.</p>

  <p>33 [<span class="it">HE</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ה</span>] Teach me, O LORD, the way of your statutes, and I shall keep it to the end.</p>

  <p>34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law. I shall even observe it with my whole heart.</p>

  <p>35 Make me to go in the path of your commandments, for in that I delight.</p>

  <p>36 Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to covetousness.</p>

  <p>37 Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity and revive me in your way.</p>

  <p>38 Establish your word to your servant who is devoted to your fear.</p>

  <p>39 Turn away my reproach which I fear, for your judgments are good.</p>

  <p>40 Behold, I have longed after your precepts. Revive me in your righteousness.</p>

  <p>41 [<span class="it">VAU</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ו</span>] Let your mercies come also to me, O LORD, even your salvation, according to your word.</p>

  <p>42 And I shall have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I trust in your word.</p>

  <p>43 And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in your judgments.</p>

  <p>44 And I shall keep your law continually forever and ever.</p>

  <p>45 And I will walk at liberty, for I seek your precepts.</p>

  <p>46 I will also speak of your testimonies before kings and will not be ashamed.</p>

  <p>47 And I will delight myself in your commandments, which I have loved.</p>

  <p>48 I will also lift my hands to your commandments, which I have loved. And I will meditate in your statutes.</p>

  <p>49 [<span class="it">ZAIN</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ז</span>] Remember the word to your servant, upon which you have caused me to hope.</p>

  <p>50 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.</p>

  <p>51 The proud have had me greatly in derision, yet I have not declined from your law.</p>

  <p>52 I remembered your judgments of old, O LORD, and have comforted myself.</p>

  <p>53 Horror has taken hold upon me because of the wicked who forsake your law.</p>

  <p>54 Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>55 I have remembered your name, O LORD, in the night and have kept your law.</p>

  <p>56 This I had because I kept your precepts.</p>

  <p>57 [<span class="it">CHETH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ח</span>] You are my portion, O LORD. I have said that I would keep your words.</p>

  <p>58 I entreated your favor with my whole heart. Be merciful to me according to your word.</p>

  <p>59 I considered my ways and turned my feet to your testimonies.</p>

  <p>60 I made haste and did not delay to keep your commandments.</p>

  <p>61 The ropes of the wicked have surrounded me, but I have not forgotten your law.</p>

  <p>62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you because of your righteous judgments.</p>

  <p>63 I am a companion of all those who fear you and of those who keep your precepts.</p>

  <p>64 The earth, O LORD, is full of your mercy. Teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>65 [<span class="it">TETH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ט</span>] You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word.</p>

  <p>66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed your commandments.</p>

  <p>67 Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept your word.</p>

  <p>68 You are good and do good. Teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>69 The proud have forged a lie against me, but I will keep your precepts with my whole heart.</p>

  <p>70 Their heart is as gross as fat, but I delight in your law.</p>

  <p>71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted so that I might learn your statutes.</p>

  <p>72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>

  <p>73 [<span class="it">JOD</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">י</span>] Your hands have made me and fashioned me. Give me understanding so that I may learn your commandments.</p>

  <p>74 Those who fear you will be glad when they see me because I have hoped in your word.</p>

  <p>75 I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right and that you in faithfulness have afflicted me.</p>

  <p>76 Let, I pray you, your merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to your word to your servant.</p>

  <p>77 Let your tender mercies come to me so that I may live, for your law is my delight.</p>

  <p>78 Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause. But I will meditate in your precepts.</p>

  <p>79 Let those who fear you turn to me, and those who have known your testimonies.</p>

  <p>80 Let my heart be sound in your statutes so that I may not be ashamed.</p>

  <p>81 [<span class="it">CAPH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">כ</span>] My soul faints for your salvation, but I hope in your word.</p>

  <p>82 My eyes fail for your word, saying, "When will you comfort me?"</p>

  <p>83 For I have become like a bottle in the smoke, yet I do not forget your statutes.</p>

  <p>84 How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?</p>

  <p>85 The proud have dug pits for me, which are not according to your law.</p>

  <p>86 All your commandments are faithful. They persecute me wrongfully. Help me.</p>

  <p>87 They had almost consumed me upon earth, but I did not forsake your precepts.</p>

  <p>88 Revive me after your loving-kindness, and I shall keep the testimony of your mouth.</p>

  <p>89 [<span class="it">LAMED</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ל</span>] Forever, O LORD, your word is settled in heaven.</p>

  <p>90 Your faithfulness is to all generations. You have established the earth, and it abides.</p>

  <p>91 They continue this day according to your ordinances, for all are your servants.</p>

  <p>92 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.</p>

  <p>93 I will never forget your precepts, for with them you have revived me.</p>

  <p>94 I am yours. Save me, for I have sought your precepts.</p>

  <p>95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me, but I will consider your testimonies.</p>

  <p>96 I have seen an end of all perfection, but your commandment is exceeding broad.</p>

  <p>97 [<span class="it">MEM</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">מ</span>] O how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day.</p>

  <p>98 You, through your commandments, have made me wiser than my enemies, for they are always with me.</p>

  <p>99 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation.</p>

  <p>100 I understand more than the ancients because I keep your precepts.</p>

  <p>101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way so that I might keep your word.</p>

  <p>102 I have not departed from your judgments, for you have taught me.</p>

  <p>103 How sweet your words are to my taste! They are even sweeter than honey to my mouth!</p>

  <p>104 Through your precepts I get understanding; therefore, I hate every false way.</p>

  <p>105 [<span class="it">NUN</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">נ</span>] Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.</p>

  <p>106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep your righteous judgments.</p>

  <p>107 I am afflicted very much. Revive me, O LORD, according to your word.</p>

  <p>108 Accept, I implore you, the voluntary-offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me your judgments.</p>

  <p>109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I do not forget your law.</p>

  <p>110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I did not err from your precepts.</p>

  <p>111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>

  <p>112 I have inclined my heart to perform your statutes always, even to the end.</p>

  <p>113 [<span class="it">SAMECH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ס</span>] I hate vain thoughts, but I love your law.</p>

  <p>114 You are my hiding place and my shield. I hope in your word.</p>

  <p>115 Depart from me, you evil-doers, for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>

  <p>116 Uphold me according to your word so that I may live, and do not let me be ashamed of my hope.</p>

  <p>117 Support me, and I shall be safe and will have respect to your statutes continually.</p>

  <p>118 You have trodden down all those who err from your statutes, for their deceit is falsehood.</p>

  <p>119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross; therefore, I love your testimonies.</p>

  <p>120 My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments.</p>

  <p>121 [<span class="it">AIN</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ע</span>] I have done judgment and justice. Do not leave me to my oppressors.</p>

  <p>122 Be surety for your servant for good. Do not let the proud oppress me.</p>

  <p>123 My eyes fail for your salvation and for the word of your righteousness.</p>

  <p>124 Deal with your servant according to your mercy and teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>125 I am your servant. Give me understanding so that I may know your testimonies.</p>

  <p>126 It is time for you, LORD, to work, for they have made your law void.</p>

  <p>127 Therefore, I love your commandments above gold, even above fine gold.</p>

  <p>128 Therefore, I esteem all your precepts concerning all things to be right and I hate every false way.</p>

  <p>129 [<span class="it">PE</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">פ</span>] Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore, my soul keeps them.</p>

  <p>130 The entrance of your words gives light. It gives understanding to the simple.</p>

  <p>131 I opened my mouth and panted, for I longed for your commandments.</p>

  <p>132 Look upon me and be merciful to me, as you always do to those who love your name.</p>

  <p>133 Order my steps in your word and do not let any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>

  <p>134 Deliver me from the oppression of man, and I will keep your precepts.</p>

  <p>135 Make your face to shine upon your servant and teach me your statutes.</p>

  <p>136 Rivers of waters run down my eyes because they do not keep your law.</p>

  <p>137 [<span class="it">TSADDI</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">צ</span>] You are righteous, O LORD, and your judgments are upright.</p>

  <p>138 Your testimonies that you have commanded are righteous and very faithful.</p>

  <p>139 My zeal has consumed me because my enemies have forgotten your words.</p>

  <p>140 Your word is very pure; therefore, your servant loves it.</p>

  <p>141 I am small and despised, yet I do not forget your precepts.</p>

  <p>142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and your law is the truth.</p>

  <p>143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me, yet your commandments are my delights.</p>

  <p>144 The righteousness of your testimonies is everlasting. Give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>

  <p>145 [<span class="it">KOPH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ק</span>] I cried with my whole heart. Hear me, O LORD. I will keep your statutes.</p>

  <p>146 I cried to you. Save me, and I shall keep your testimonies.</p>

  <p>147 I came before the dawning of the morning and cried. I hoped in your word.</p>

  <p>148 My eyes anticipated the night watches so that I might meditate in your word.</p>

  <p>149 Hear my voice according to your loving-kindness. O LORD, revive me according to your judgment.</p>

  <p>150 They draw near who follow after mischief. They are far from your law.</p>

  <p>151 You are near, O LORD, and all your commandments are truth.</p>

  <p>152 Concerning your testimonies, I have known of old that you have founded them forever.</p>

  <p>153 [<span class="it">RESH</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ר</span>] Consider my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget your law.</p>

  <p>154 Plead my cause and deliver me. Revive me according to your word.</p>

  <p>155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek your statutes.</p>

  <p>156 Your tender mercies are great, O LORD. Revive me according to your judgments.</p>

  <p>157 Many are my persecutors and my enemies, yet I do not decline from your testimonies.</p>

  <p>158 I beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they did not keep your word.</p>

  <p>159 Consider how I love your precepts. Revive me, O LORD, according to your loving-kindness.</p>

  <p>160 Your word is true from the beginning. Every one of your righteous judgments endures forever.</p>

  <p>161 [<span class="it">SCHIN</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ש</span>] Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands in awe of your word.</p>

  <p>162 I rejoice at your word as one who finds great spoil.</p>

  <p>163 I hate and abhor lying, but I love your law.</p>

  <p>164 Seven times a day I praise you because of your righteous judgments.</p>

  <p>165 Those who love your law have great peace, and nothing shall cause them to stumble.</p>

  <p>166 LORD, I have hoped for your salvation and performed your commandments.</p>

  <p>167 My soul has kept your testimonies, and I love them exceedingly.</p>

  <p>168 I have kept your precepts and your testimonies, for all my ways are before you.</p>

  <p>169 [<span class="it">TAU</span> - <span class="gr-heb bold">ת</span>] Let my cry come near before you, O LORD. Give me understanding according to your word.</p>

  <p>170 Let my supplication come before you. Deliver me according to your word.</p>

  <p>171 My lips shall utter praise when you have taught me your statutes.</p>

  <p>172 My tongue shall speak of your word, for all your commandments are righteousness.</p>

  <p>173 Let your hand help me, for I have chosen your precepts.</p>

  <p>174 I have longed for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight.</p>

  <p>175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise you. Let your judgments help me.</p>

  <p>176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep. Seek your servant, for I do not forget your commandments.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z4CB4-nfeUZ-1wyXWooTas2vl8I-WDPOiLQwl4wVS7Q" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 119</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.105] - Christ is not only the word, but also the lamp and the light. See the comment for 2nd Samuel 22:29. Reference, John 1:1, 4, 9.</p>
  <p>[v.115] - Quoted in Matthew 7:23.</p>
  <p>[v.136] - "they" - From John Gill's Exposition: "The persons are not mentioned, but must be understood of wicked men; whose open and impudent transgression of the law in innumerable instances, and in the most flagrant manner, gave the psalmist great distress, as it does all good men; because the law of God is despised, his authority is trampled on, his name is dishonored, and he has not the glory which is due unto him."</p>
