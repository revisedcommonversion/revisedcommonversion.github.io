    <p>2&emsp; Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with the whole heart.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; They also do no iniquity. They walk in his ways.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; You have commanded us to keep your precepts diligently.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; O that my ways were directed to keep your statutes!</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Then I shall not be ashamed when I have respect for all your commandments.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; I will praise you with uprightness of heart when I have learned your righteous judgments.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; I will keep your statutes. O do not forsake me utterly.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;With my whole heart I have sought you. O do not let me wander from your commandments.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;I have hid your word in my heart so that I might not sin against you.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Blessed are you, O LORD. Teach me your statutes.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;With my lips I have declared all the judgments of your mouth.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much as in all riches.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;I will meditate in your precepts and have respect for your ways.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;I will delight myself in your statutes. I will not forget your word.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Open my eyes so that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;I am a stranger in the earth. Do not hide your commandments from me.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;My soul breaks for the longing that it has to your judgments at all times.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who err from your commandments.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept your testimonies.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;Princes also sat and spoke against me, but your servant meditated in your statutes.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Your testimonies are also my delight and my counselors.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;Make me to understand the way of your precepts, and I shall talk of your wondrous works.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;My soul melts for heaviness. Strengthen me according to your word.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;Remove from me the way of lying and grant me your law graciously.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;I have chosen the way of truth. Your judgments I have laid before me.</p>

    <p>31&emsp;I have adhered to your testimonies. O LORD, do not put me to shame.</p>

    <p>35&emsp;Make me to go in the path of your commandments, for in that I delight.</p>

    <p>36&emsp;Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to covetousness.</p>

    <p>37&emsp;Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity and revive me in your way.</p>

    <p>38&emsp;Establish your word to your servant who is devoted to your fear.</p>

    <p>43&emsp;And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I have hoped in your judgments.</p>

    <p>44&emsp;And I shall keep your law continually forever and ever.</p>

    <p>45&emsp;And I will walk at liberty, for I seek your precepts.</p>

    <p>46&emsp;I will also speak of your testimonies before kings and will not be ashamed.</p>

    <p>47&emsp;And I will delight myself in your commandments, which I have loved.</p>

    <p>48&emsp;I will also lift my hands to your commandments, which I have loved. And I will meditate in your statutes.</p>

    <p>49&emsp;Remember the word to your servant, upon which you have caused me to hope.</p>

    <p>50&emsp;This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.</p>

    <p>51&emsp;The proud have had me greatly in derision, yet I have not declined from your law.</p>

    <p>52&emsp;I remembered your judgments of old, O LORD, and have comforted myself.</p>

    <p>53&emsp;Horror has taken hold upon me because of the wicked who forsake your law.</p>

    <p>54&emsp;Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>

    <p>55&emsp;I have remembered your name, O LORD, in the night and have kept your law.</p>

    <p>56&emsp;This I had because I kept your precepts.</p>

    <p>58&emsp;I entreated your favor with my whole heart. Be merciful to me according to your word.</p>

    <p>59&emsp;I considered my ways and turned my feet to your testimonies.</p>

    <p>60&emsp;I made haste and did not delay to keep your commandments.</p>

    <p>61&emsp;The ropes of the wicked have surrounded me, but I have not forgotten your law.</p>

    <p>62&emsp;At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you because of your righteous judgments.</p>

    <p>63&emsp;I am a companion of all those who fear you and of those who keep your precepts.</p>

    <p>64&emsp;The earth, O LORD, is full of your mercy. Teach me your statutes.</p>

    <p>66&emsp;Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed your commandments.</p>

    <p>67&emsp;Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I have kept your word.</p>

    <p>68&emsp;You are good and do good. Teach me your statutes.</p>

    <p>69&emsp;The proud have forged a lie against me, but I will keep your precepts with my whole heart.</p>

    <p>70&emsp;Their heart is as gross as fat, but I delight in your law.</p>

    <p>71&emsp;It is good for me that I have been afflicted so that I might learn your statutes.</p>

    <p>72&emsp;The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>

    <p>75&emsp;I know, O LORD, that your judgments are right and that you in faithfulness have afflicted me.</p>

    <p>76&emsp;Let, I pray you, your merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to your word to your servant.</p>

    <p>77&emsp;Let your tender mercies come to me so that I may live, for your law is my delight.</p>

    <p>78&emsp;Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause. But I will meditate in your precepts.</p>

    <p>79&emsp;Let those who fear you turn to me, and those who have known your testimonies.</p>

    <p>80&emsp;Let my heart be sound in your statutes so that I may not be ashamed.</p>

    <p>83&emsp;For I have become like a bottle in the smoke, yet I do not forget your statutes.</p>

    <p>84&emsp;How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?</p>

    <p>85&emsp;The proud have dug pits for me, which are not according to your law.</p>

    <p>86&emsp;All your commandments are faithful. They persecute me wrongfully. Help me.</p>

    <p>87&emsp;They had almost consumed me upon earth, but I did not forsake your precepts.</p>

    <p>88&emsp;Revive me after your loving-kindness, and I shall keep the testimony of your mouth.</p>

    <p>92&emsp;Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.</p>

    <p>93&emsp;I will never forget your precepts, for with them you have revived me.</p>

    <p>94&emsp;I am yours. Save me, for I have sought your precepts.</p>

    <p>95&emsp;The wicked have waited for me to destroy me, but I will consider your testimonies.</p>

    <p>107&emsp;I am afflicted very much. Revive me, O LORD, according to your word.</p>

    <p>108&emsp;Accept, I implore you, the voluntary-offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me your judgments.</p>

    <p>109&emsp;My soul is continually in my hand, yet I do not forget your law.</p>

    <p>110&emsp;The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I did not err from your precepts.</p>

    <p>111&emsp;I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>

  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>As this psalm treats of various matters, it is difficult to give an epitome of its contents. There are, however, two things which the prophet mainly aims at; the exhorting of the children of God to follow godliness and a holy life; and the prescribing of the rule, and pointing out the form of the true worship of God, so that the faithful may devote themselves wholly to the study of the Law. Along with these he frequently blends promises for the purpose of animating the worshippers of God to live more justly and piously; and, at the same time, he introduces complaints respecting the impious contempt of the Law, lest they should become tainted by bad examples. In short, he frequently passes from one topic to another, and prosecutes no one particular subject continuously; and therefore it will be best to discuss each subject in its proper place.</p>
  <p>[v.105] - Christ is not only the word, but also the lamp and the light. See the comment for 2nd Samuel 22:29. Reference, John 1:1, 4, 9.</p>
  <p>[v.115] - Quoted in Matthew 7:23.</p>
  <p>[v.136] - "they" - From John Gill's Exposition: "The persons are not mentioned, but must be understood of wicked men; whose open and impudent transgression of the law in innumerable instances, and in the most flagrant manner, gave the psalmist great distress, as it does all good men; because the law of God is despised, his authority is trampled on, his name is dishonored, and he has not the glory which is due unto him."</p>
