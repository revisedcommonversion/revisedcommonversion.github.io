  <p>1 Praise the LORD. O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. For his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? Who can show forth all his praise?</p>

  <p>3 Blessed are those who keep judgment and he who does righteousness at all times.</p>

  <p>4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favor that you bear to your people. O visit me with your salvation,</p>

  <p>5 So that I may see the good of your chosen, so that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, so that I may glory with your inheritance.</p>

  <p>6 We have sinned with our fathers. We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.</p>

  <p>7 Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of your mercies, but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p>

  <p>8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake so that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>

  <p>9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up. Thus he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>

  <p>10 And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>

  <p>11 And the waters covered their enemies. There was not one of them left.</p>

  <p>12 Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.</p>

  <p>13 They soon forgot his works. They did not wait for his counsel,</p>

  <p>14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tested God in the desert.</p>

  <p>15 And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</p>

  <p>16 They also envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>

  <p>17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</p>

  <p>18 And a fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.</p>

  <p>19 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped the molten image.</p>

  <p>20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.</p>

  <p>21 They forgot God their Savior who had done great things in Egypt,</p>

  <p>22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham and awesome things by the Red Sea;</p>

  <p>23 Therefore, he said that he would destroy them, had Moses his chosen not stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>

  <p>24 They even despised the pleasant land and did not believe his word,</p>

  <p>25 But murmured in their tents and did not listen to the voice of the LORD;</p>

  <p>26 Therefore, he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness,</p>

  <p>27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>

  <p>28 They joined themselves also to Baal-peor and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>

  <p>29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions, and the plague broke in upon them.</p>

  <p>30 Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment. And so the plague was stayed.</p>

  <p>31 And that was counted to him for righteousness to all generations forever.</p>

  <p>32 They also angered him at the waters of strife so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes,</p>

  <p>33 For they provoked his spirit and he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.</p>

  <p>34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them,</p>

  <p>35 But were mingled among the heathen and learned their works.</p>

  <p>36 And they served their idols, which were a snare to them.</p>

  <p>37 They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</p>

  <p>38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. And the land was polluted with blood.</p>

  <p>39 Thus they were defiled with their own works and went astray with their own inventions.</p>

  <p>40 Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against his people because he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>

  <p>41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen, and those who hated them ruled over them.</p>

  <p>42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>

  <p>43 Many times he delivered them, but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>

  <p>44 Nevertheless, he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry.</p>

  <p>45 And he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

  <p>46 He also made them to be pitied by all those who carried them captives.</p>

  <p>47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, so that we may give thanks to your holy name and triumph in your praise.</p>

  <p>48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. And let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the LORD.</p>
