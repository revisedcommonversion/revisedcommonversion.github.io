    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Praise the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who can show forth all his praise?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Blessed are those who keep judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who does righteousness at all times.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Remember me, O LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the favor that you bear to your people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O visit me with your salvation,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> So that I may see the good of your chosen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may glory with your inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> We have sinned with our fathers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have committed iniquity. We have done wickedly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They did not remember the multitude of your mercies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Nevertheless, he saved them for his name's sake<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And the waters covered their enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There was not one of them left.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Then they believed his words.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They sang his praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They soon forgot his works.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They did not wait for his counsel,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and tested God in the desert.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And he gave them their request,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but sent leanness into their soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> They also envied Moses in the camp,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and covered the company of Abiram.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And a fire was kindled in their company.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The flame burned up the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> They made a calf in Horeb<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and worshiped the molten image.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Thus they changed their glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> They forgot God their Savior<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who had done great things in Egypt,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and awesome things by the Red Sea;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Therefore, he said that he would destroy them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />had Moses his chosen not stood before him in the breach<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They even despised the pleasant land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not believe his word,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> But murmured in their tents<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not listen to the voice of the LORD;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Therefore, he lifted up his hand against them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to overthrow them in the wilderness,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> To overthrow their offspring also among the nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to scatter them in the lands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> They joined themselves also to Baal-peor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the plague broke in upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And so the plague was stayed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> And that was counted to him for righteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to all generations forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> They also angered him at the waters of strife<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> For they provoked his spirit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> They did not destroy the nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />concerning whom the LORD commanded them,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> But were mingled among the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and learned their works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> And they served their idols,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which were a snare to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> And shed innocent blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the land was polluted with blood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> Thus they were defiled with their own works<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and went astray with their own inventions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> Therefore, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who hated them ruled over them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> Many times he delivered them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they provoked him with their counsel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">44</span> Nevertheless, he regarded their affliction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he heard their cry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">45</span> And he remembered for them his covenant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">46</span> He also made them to be pitied<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by all those who carried them captives.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">47</span> Save us, O LORD our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gather us from among the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may give thanks to your holy name<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and triumph in your praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">48</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from everlasting to everlasting.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let all the people say, "Amen."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20106.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 106</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch as there the Psalmist showed that God had been more than a bountiful father to his chosen people, in order to procure for himself, in coming ages, a race of pure worshippers, while here he acknowledges that these remarkable benefits had been turned to a bad account; because the Jews from time to time threw off the yoke of God, basely abused his kindness, defiled themselves with many pollutions, and also perfidiously departed from his word. Nevertheless, it is not so much in the shape of a reproof or complaint, as a confession of their sins, in order to the obtaining the pardon of them. For the prophet commences with the praises of God, with the design of encouraging both himself and others to cherish good hope in him. Then he prays that God would continue his blessing to the seed of Abraham. But because the people, after so frequently revolting from God, were unworthy of the continuation of his kindness, he asks pardon to be extended to them, and this after he had confessed that from first to last, they had provoked God's wrath by their malice, ingratitude, pride, perfidy, and other vices.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in Luke 1:71.</p>
  <p>[v.33] - "his spirit" - This is referring to the spirit of Moses.</p>
