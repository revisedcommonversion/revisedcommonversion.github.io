  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O sing to the LORD a new song. Sing to the LORD, all the earth.</p>

  <p>2 Sing to the LORD. Bless his name. Show forth his salvation from day to day.</p>

  <p>3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>

  <p>4 For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised. He is to be feared above all gods.</p>

  <p>5 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.</p>

  <p>6 Honor and majesty are before him. Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</p>

  <p>7 Give to the LORD, O kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.</p>

  <p>8 Give to the LORD the glory due to his name. Bring an offering and come into his courts.</p>

  <p>9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. Fear before him, all the earth.</p>

  <p>10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigns. The world shall also be established so that it shall not be moved. He will judge the people righteously.</p>

  <p>11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. Let the sea roar, and its fullness.</p>

  <p>12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the wood shall rejoice before the LORD.</p>

  <p>13 For he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>
