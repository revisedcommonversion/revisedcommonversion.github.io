  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] Blessed is he who considers the poor. The LORD will deliver him in the time of trouble.</p>

  <p>2 The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth. And you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.</p>

  <p>3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing. You will restore his health in his sickness.</p>

  <p>4 I said, "LORD, be merciful to me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against you."</p>

  <p>5 My enemies speak evil of me, "When shall he die and his name perish?"</p>

  <p>6 And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.</p>

  <p>7 All who hate me whisper together against me. They devise my hurt against me.</p>

  <p>8 "An evil disease," they say, "cleaves fast to him. And now that he lies he shall rise no more."</p>

  <p>9 Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</p>

  <p>10 But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up so that I may requite them.</p>

  <p>11 By this I know that you favor me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.</p>

  <p>12 And as for me, you uphold me in my integrity and set me before your face forever.</p>

  <p>13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.</p>
