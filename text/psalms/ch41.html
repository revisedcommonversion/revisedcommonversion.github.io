  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>] Blessed is he who considers the poor. The LORD will deliver him in the time of trouble.</p>

  <p>2 The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth. And you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.</p>

  <p>3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing. You will restore his health in his sickness.</p>

  <p>4 I said, "LORD, be merciful to me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against you."</p>

  <p>5 My enemies speak evil of me, "When shall he die and his name perish?"</p>

  <p>6 And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity. His heart gathers iniquity to itself. When he goes abroad, he tells it.</p>

  <p>7 All who hate me whisper together against me. They devise my hurt against me.</p>

  <p>8 "An evil disease," they say, "cleaves fast to him. And now that he lies he shall rise no more."</p>

  <p>9 Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</p>

  <p>10 But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up so that I may requite them.</p>

  <p>11 By this I know that you favor me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.</p>

  <p>12 And as for me, you uphold me in my integrity and set me before your face forever.</p>

  <p>13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20041.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 41</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, while he was severely afflicted by the hand of God, perceived that he was unjustly blamed by men who regarded him as one who had already been condemned and devoted to eternal destruction. Under this trial he fortifies himself by the consolation of hope. At the same time, he complains partly of the cruelty, and partly of the treachery, of his enemies. And although he recognises the affliction with which he is visited as a just punishment of his sins, yet he charges his enemies with cruelty and malice, inasmuch as they troubled and afflicted one who had always endeavored to do them good. Finally, he records an expression of his gratitude and joy, because he had been preserved by the grace of God.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "the poor" - This may also be read as, "those who are in trouble," or, "the afflicted."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in John 13:18.</p>
