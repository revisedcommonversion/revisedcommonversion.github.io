  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Blessed is he who considers the poor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD will deliver him in the time of trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The LORD will preserve him and keep him alive,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall be blessed upon the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You will restore his health in his sickness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I said, "LORD, be merciful to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Heal my soul, for I have sinned against you."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> My enemies speak evil of me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"When shall he die and his name perish?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And if he comes to see me, he speaks vanity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His heart gathers iniquity to itself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When he goes abroad, he tells it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All who hate me whisper together against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They devise my hurt against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "An evil disease," they say, "cleaves fast to him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And now that he lies he shall rise no more."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and raise me up<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may requite them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> By this I know that you favor me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because my enemy does not triumph over me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And as for me, you uphold me in my integrity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set me before your face forever.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from everlasting to everlasting.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Amen and amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20041.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 41</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>David, while he was severely afflicted by the hand of God, perceived that he was unjustly blamed by men who regarded him as one who had already been condemned and devoted to eternal destruction. Under this trial he fortifies himself by the consolation of hope. At the same time, he complains partly of the cruelty, and partly of the treachery, of his enemies. And although he recognises the affliction with which he is visited as a just punishment of his sins, yet he charges his enemies with cruelty and malice, inasmuch as they troubled and afflicted one who had always endeavored to do them good. Finally, he records an expression of his gratitude and joy, because he had been preserved by the grace of God.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "the poor" - This may also be read as, "those who are in trouble," or, "the afflicted."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in John 13:18.</p>
