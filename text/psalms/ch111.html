  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Praise the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.</p>

  <p>2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out by all those who have pleasure in them.</p>

  <p>3 His work is honorable and glorious and his righteousness endures forever.</p>

  <p>4 He has made his wonderful works to be remembered. The LORD is gracious and full of compassion.</p>

  <p>5 He has given food to those who fear him. He will always be mindful of his covenant.</p>

  <p>6 He has shown his people the power of his works so that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>

  <p>7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment. All his commandments are sure.</p>

  <p>8 They stand fast forever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness.</p>

  <p>9 He sent redemption to his people. He has commanded his covenant forever. Holy and reverend is his name.</p>

  <p>10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. All those who do his commandments have a good understanding. His praise endures forever.</p>
