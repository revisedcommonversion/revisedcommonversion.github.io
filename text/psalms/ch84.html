  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. A Psalm for the Sons of Korah.</span>] How amiable your tabernacles are, O LORD of hosts!</p>

  <p>2 My soul longs and even faints for the courts of the LORD. My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</p>

  <p>3 Even the sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young near your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God.</p>

  <p>4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house. They will be still praising you. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>

  <p>6 Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a well. The rain also fills the pools.</p>

  <p>7 They go from strength to strength. Every one of them in Zion appears before God.</p>

  <p>8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer. Give ear, O God of Jacob. [<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

  <p>9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of your anointed.</p>

  <p>10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand [elsewhere]. I would rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>

  <p>11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield. The LORD will give grace and glory. No good will he withhold from those who walk uprightly.</p>

  <p>12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in you.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.10] - Text in square brackets added for implied meaning. Taken from John Calvin's Commentary. From John Gill's Exposition: "A day thus spent in religious exercises 'is better than a thousand'; that is, than a thousand days; not than a thousand days spent in like manner, but than a thousand other days, common day, of the week; or than a thousand in other places, especially in places of sin, and in the company of wicked men; one day in God's house employed in spiritual exercises, and enjoying communion with him, is better than a thousand days in any of the houses of Satan, of sinful pleasure, or in the houses of sinful men; better as to peace of mind, solid pleasure, real profit, and true honour."</p>
