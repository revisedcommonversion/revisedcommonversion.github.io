  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. For his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>2 Let Israel now say that his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>3 Let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>4 Let those who fear the LORD now say that his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <p>5 I called upon the LORD in distress. The LORD answered me and set me in a large place.</p>

  <p>6 The LORD is on my side. I will not fear. What can man do to me?</p>

  <p>7 The LORD takes my part with those who help me; therefore, I shall see my desire upon those who hate me.</p>

  <p>8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</p>

  <p>9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</p>

  <p>10 All nations encompassed me, but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

  <p>11 They encompassed me. Yes, they encompassed me, but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

  <p>12 They encompassed me like bees. They are quenched as the fire of thorns, for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

  <p>13 You have violently thrust at me so that I might fall, but the LORD helped me.</p>

  <p>14 The LORD is my strength and song and has become my salvation.</p>

  <p>15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous. The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.</p>

  <p>16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted. The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.</p>

  <p>17 I shall not die, but live and declare the works of the LORD.</p>

  <p>18 The LORD has chastened me severely, but he has not given me over to death.</p>

  <p>19 Open to me the gates of righteousness. I will enter them and will praise the LORD.</p>

  <p>20 This is the gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</p>

  <p>21 I will praise you, for you have heard me and have become my salvation.</p>

  <p>22 The stone which the builders refused has become the head stone of the corner.</p>

  <p>23 This is the LORD'S doing. It is wonderful in our eyes.</p>

  <p>24 This is the day which the LORD has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>

  <p>25 Save now, I implore you, O LORD. O LORD, I implore you, send prosperity now.</p>

  <p>26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD. We have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p>

  <p>27 God is the LORD, who has shown us light. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.</p>

  <p>28 You are my God, and I will praise you. My God, I will exalt you.</p>

  <p>29 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good. For his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://personal.onlyoffice.com/Products/Files/DocEditor.aspx?fileid=3895561&doc=OXc1a0JZdEh4MGVGR1JUTTJpb3V1K1FacWtSZjRzcVhrOXNHR2Y0bFhKVT0_IjM4OTU1NjEi0" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 118</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>At the time when this psalm was penned, whenever that was, David having attained to the possession of royal power, and aware that he reigned for the common safety of the Church, calls upon all the children of Abraham to ponder attentively this grace. He also recounts his dangers, the magnitude and variety of which would have slain him a hundred times, had not God wonderfully succored him. From this it is obvious that he came to the throne of the kingdom, neither by his own policy, nor by the favor of men, nor by any human means. At the same time, he informs us that he did not rashly or by wicked intrigues rush forward and take forcible possession of the kingdom of Saul, but that he was appointed and established king by God himself. Let us remember that it was the design of the Spirit, under the figure of this temporal kingdom, to describe the eternal and spiritual kingdom of God's Son, even as David represented his person.</p>
