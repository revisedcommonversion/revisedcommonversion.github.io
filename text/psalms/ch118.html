  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; Let Israel now say<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Let the house of Aaron now say<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Let those who fear the LORD now say<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; I called upon the LORD in distress.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD answered me and set me in a large place.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The LORD is on my side.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What can man do to me?</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The LORD takes my part with those who help me;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I shall see my desire upon those who hate me.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; It is better to trust in the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than to put confidence in man.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; It is better to trust in the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than to put confidence in princes.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;All nations encompassed me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;They encompassed me. Yes, they encompassed me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;They encompassed me like bees. They are quenched as the fire of thorns,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;You have violently thrust at me so that I might fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD helped me.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;The LORD is my strength and song<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has become my salvation.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;The right hand of the LORD is exalted.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The right hand of the LORD does valiantly.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;I shall not die, but live<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and declare the works of the LORD.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;The LORD has chastened me severely,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he has not given me over to death.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;Open to me the gates of righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will enter them and will praise the LORD.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;This is the gate of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into which the righteous shall enter.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;I will praise you, for you have heard me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have become my salvation.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;The stone which the builders refused<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />has become the head stone of the corner.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;This is the LORD'S doing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is wonderful in our eyes.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;This is the day which the LORD has made.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Save now, I implore you, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD, I implore you, send prosperity now.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;God is the LORD, who has shown us light.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;You are my God, and I will praise you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My God, I will exalt you.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For his mercy endures forever.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20118.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 118</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>At the time when this psalm was penned, whenever that was, David having attained to the possession of royal power, and aware that he reigned for the common safety of the Church, calls upon all the children of Abraham to ponder attentively this grace. He also recounts his dangers, the magnitude and variety of which would have slain him a hundred times, had not God wonderfully succored him. From this it is obvious that he came to the throne of the kingdom, neither by his own policy, nor by the favor of men, nor by any human means. At the same time, he informs us that he did not rashly or by wicked intrigues rush forward and take forcible possession of the kingdom of Saul, but that he was appointed and established king by God himself. Let us remember that it was the design of the Spirit, under the figure of this temporal kingdom, to describe the eternal and spiritual kingdom of God's Son, even as David represented his person.</p>
