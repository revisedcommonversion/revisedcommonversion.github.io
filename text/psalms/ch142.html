  <p>1 [<span class="it">Maschil of David: a prayer when he was in the cave.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I cried to the LORD with my voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With my voice to the LORD I made my supplication.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; I poured out my complaint before him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I uttered before him my trouble.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you knew my path.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the way in which I walked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have secretly laid a snare for me.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; I looked on my right hand and beheld,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but there was no man who would know me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Refuge failed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No man cared for my soul.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; I cried to you, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I said, "You are my refuge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my portion in the land of the living."</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Attend to my cry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am brought very low.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Deliver me from my persecutors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are stronger than I am.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Bring my soul out of prison<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may praise your name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The righteous shall encompass me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you will deal bountifully with me.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>When Saul came into the cave where David lay concealed, this saint of God might upon such an occurrence have been either thrown into consternation, or led by his alarm into some unwarrantable step, it being common for persons in despair either to be prostrated with dismay, or driven into frenzy. But it appears from this Psalm that David retained his composure, relying with assured confidence upon God, and resigning himself to vows and prayers instead of taking any unauthorized steps.</p>
