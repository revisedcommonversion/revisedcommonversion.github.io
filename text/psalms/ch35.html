  <p>1 [<span class="it">A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Plead my cause, O LORD, with those who strive with me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Fight against those who fight against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Take hold of shield and buckler<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stand up for my help.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Draw out the spear also and stop the way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against those who persecute me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Let them be confounded and put to shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who seek after my soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be turned back and brought to shame<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who devise my hurt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Let them be like chaff before the wind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the angel of the LORD chase them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Let their way be dark and slippery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For without cause they have hid for me their net in a pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which without cause they have dug for my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Let destruction come upon him unexpectedly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let his net that he has hid catch himself.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Into that very destruction let him fall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> All my bones shall say, "LORD, who is like you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the poor and the needy from him who robs him?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> False witnesses arose.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They laid to my charge things that I did not know.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> They rewarded me evil for good<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the bereaving of my soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But as for me, when they were sick,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my clothing was sackcloth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I humbled my soul with fasting,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my prayer returned into my own bosom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I bowed down heavily like one who mourns for his mother.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> But in my adversity they rejoiced and assembled themselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The abjects even assembled themselves against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I did not know it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They tore me and did not cease.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> With hypocritical mockers in feasts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Lord, how long will you look on?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Rescue my soul from their destructions,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my darling from the lions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> I will give you thanks in the great congregation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will praise you among many people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Do not let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither let them wink with the eye<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who hate me without a cause.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> For they do not speak peace,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they devise deceitful matters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against those who are quiet in the land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> They even opened their mouth wide against me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and said, "Aha, aha, our eye has seen it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> This you have seen, O LORD. Do not keep silence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O Lord, do not be far from me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Stir up yourself and awake to my judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even to my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Judge me, O LORD my God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to your righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let them rejoice over me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Do not let them say in their hearts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Ah, we would have it so."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not let them say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"We have swallowed him up."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who rejoice at my hurt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who magnify themselves against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Let them shout for joy and be glad<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who favor my righteous cause.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them even say continually,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Let the LORD be magnified,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And my tongue shall speak of your righteousness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of your praise all the day long.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20035.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 35</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>So long as Saul was the enemy of David, the nobles, and such as at that time bore any authority, had (according to the subservient spirit which always prevails in the courts of kings) eagerly conspired to destroy an innocent man. They had also succeeded in inducing the common people to participate with them in their hatred and cruelty, so that all of them, from the highest to the lowest, burned with implacable hatred against him. But as he knew that the greatest part of them were thoughtlessly impelled to this by error and folly, and ignorance of the true state of affairs, he accounts those only his enemies who, from deliberate malice and wickedness, endeavored in this way to please Saul, in order to obtain his favor. Against them he calls upon God for vengeance. And, first, as he was conscious of no crime, he alleges his innocence before God; and, secondly, as they sought to inflict unmerited punishment upon him, he implores God for deliverance. After he has complained of their impious cruelty, he calls down upon them the punishment which they deserved. Moreover, as in confident reliance upon the oracle of God, which had been spoken by Samuel, and the holy anointing, he hoped for a better issue, he intersperses throughout the psalm testimonies of his thankfulness. Finally, he concludes the psalm by saying, that after he has been delivered, he will celebrate the praises of God all his life.</p>
