  <p>1 [<span class="it">To the Chief Musician, even to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">I said, "I will take heed to my ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I do not sin with my tongue.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will keep my mouth with a bridle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />while the wicked is before me."</p>

    <p>2&emsp; I was mute with silence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I held my peace, even from good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my sorrow was stirred.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; My heart was hot within me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />While I was musing, the fire burned.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then I spoke with my tongue:</p>

    <p>4&emsp; "LORD, make me to know my end<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the measure of my days, what it is,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may know how frail I am.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Behold, you have made my days as a hand-breadth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my age is as nothing before you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>6&emsp; "Surely every man walks in a vain show.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely they are disquieted in vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He heaps up riches and does not know who gathers them.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; And now, Lord, what do I wait for?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My hope is in you.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Deliver me from all my transgressions.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; I was mute. I did not open my mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you did it.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Remove your stroke away from me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am consumed by the blow of your hand.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;When you, with rebukes, correct man for iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you make his beauty to consume away like a moth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Surely every man is vanity."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p>12&emsp;"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not hold your peace at my tears,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I am a stranger with you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;O spare me so that I may recover strength<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before I go from here and am no more."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20039.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 39</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In the beginning of the psalm, David intimates that his heart had been seized with extreme bitterness of grief, which forced him to give utterance to complaints with too much vehemence and ardor. He confesses that whilst he was disposed to be silent, and to exercise patience, he was nevertheless compelled, by the vehemence of his sorrow, to break out into an excess which he by no means intended. Then he relates the complaints which he had made mingled with prayers, which indicate great trouble of mind; so that from this it appears that he had wrestled with no ordinary effort in resisting temptation, lest he should fall into despair.</p>
