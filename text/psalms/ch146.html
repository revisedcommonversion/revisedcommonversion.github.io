  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Praise the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD, O my soul.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; While I live I will praise the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praises to my God while I have any being.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Do not put your trust in princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; His breath goes forth and he returns to the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In that very day his thoughts perish.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose hope is in the LORD his God,</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Who made heaven, earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the sea, and all that is in them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who keeps truth forever,</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Who executes judgment for the oppressed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who gives food to the hungry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD sets the prisoners free.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; The LORD opens the eyes of the blind.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD raises those who are bowed down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD loves the righteous.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; The LORD preserves the strangers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He relieves the fatherless and widow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;The LORD will reign forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even your God, O Zion, to all generations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20146.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 146</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After stirring up himself, and others by his example, to praise God, David animadverts upon the diseased disposition, almost universally prevalent, to deceive ourselves by expectations entertained from various quarters. He, at the same time, points out the remedy&mdash; that our whole hope should be centered in God. To persuade us to resort to him more readily, he touches shortly upon some proofs of his power and mercy.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "and he returns to the earth" - That is, to the earth from which he was formed (Genesis 2:7). This is the reason some translations, including the KJV, have, "and he returns to his earth."</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoted in Acts 4:24.</p>
