    <p class="in-verse">Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have enlarged me when I was in distress.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/psalms/MHC%20-%20Psalm%20004.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Psalms, Chapter 4</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After David in the beginning of the psalm has prayed to God to help him, he immediately turns his discourse to his enemies, and depending on the promise of God, triumphs over them as a conqueror. He, therefore, teaches us by his example, that as often as we are weighed down by adversity, or involved in very great distress, we ought to meditate upon the promises of God, in which the hope of salvation is held forth to us, so that defending ourselves by this shield, we may break through all the temptations which assail us.</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "The LORD will hear when I call to him" - From John Calvin's Commentary: "Let this truth then, obtain a fixed place in our minds, that God will never withhold his assistance from those who go on sincerely in their course. Without this comfort, the faithful must inevitably sink into despondency every moment."</p>
  <p>[v.4a] - LXX: "Be angry, and do not sin; feel compunction upon your beds for what you say in your hearts. [<span class="it">Pause.</span>]"</p>
  <p>[v.4b] - Quoted in Ephesians 4:26.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "Let us therefore, learn from [David's] example, to yield this honor to God&mdash;to believe, that although there may appear no help for us from men, yet under his hand alone we are kept in peace and safety, as if we were surrounded by a great host."</p>
