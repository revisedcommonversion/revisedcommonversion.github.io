  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 This is the third time I am coming to you. "<cite>By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.</cite>" 2 I have told you before and tell you again, as when I was present the second time. So now being absent, I write to those who before have sinned and to all the rest, that, if I come again I will not spare, 3 Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but is mighty in you. 4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we are also weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</p>

  <p>5 Examine yourselves, whether you are in the faith. Prove your own selves. Do you not know as to your own selves that Jesus Christ is in you unless you are reprobates? 6 But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates. 7 Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we should be as reprobates. 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 9 For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we wish: even your perfection. 10 Therefore, I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification and not to destruction.</p>

  <p>11 Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. 12 Greet one another with a holy kiss. 13 All the saints salute you.</p>

  <p>14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</p>
