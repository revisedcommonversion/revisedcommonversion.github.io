  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia, 2 That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. 3 For I bear testimony to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they were willing of themselves, 4 Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 5 And they did this, not as we hoped, but they first gave their own selves to the Lord and then to us by the will of God. 6 So we exhorted Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</p>

  <p>7 Therefore, as you abound in everything—in faith, utterance, knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love to us—see that you abound in this grace also. 8 I do not speak by commandment, but by means of the forwardness of others, proving the sincerity of your love also. 9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor so that you, through his poverty, might be rich. 10 And in this I give my advice. For this is expedient for you, who have begun before a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing. 11 Now therefore, finish the doing also, so that as there was a readiness to will, so may there be a performance also out of that which you have. 12 For if there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man has and not according to what he does not have. 13 For I do not mean that other men should be eased and you burdened, 14 But that there may be equality. Your abundance at this time may be a supply for their need so that their abundance may also be a supply for your need. This is so that there may be equality, 15 As it is written, "<cite>He who had gathered much had nothing over, and he who had gathered little had no lack.</cite>"</p>

  <p>16 But thanks be to God, who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation, but being more forward, he went to you of his own accord. 18 And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches, 19 And not that only, but he was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord and to show our readiness. 20 We are avoiding this: that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us. 21 For we are providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. 23 If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow-worker concerning you. Or if our brothers are inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of Christ. 24 Therefore, show the proof of your love to them and before the churches and of our boasting on your behalf.</p>
