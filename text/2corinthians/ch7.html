  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p>

  <p>2 Receive us. We have wronged no man. We have corrupted no man. We have defrauded no man. 3 I do not speak this to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to die and live with you. 4 My boldness of speech is great toward you. My glorying is great concerning you. I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.</p>

  <p>5 For, when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side: outside were fightings, inside were fears. 6 Nevertheless, God, who comforts those who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus, 7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, and your fervent mind toward me, so that I rejoiced the more. 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent. For I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it was but for a season. 9 Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance. For you were made sorry after a godly manner so that you might suffer loss in nothing by us. 10 For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world works death. 11 For behold this very thing, that you sorrowed after a godly manner, what carefulness it wrought in you: what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, and what avenging! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. 12 Therefore, though I wrote to you, I did not do it for his cause who had done the wrong, nor for his cause who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you. 13 Therefore, we were comforted in your comfort. And exceedingly the more we rejoiced for the joy of Titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all. 14 For if I have boasted anything to him concerning you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. 15 And his tender affection is more abundant toward you while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</p>
