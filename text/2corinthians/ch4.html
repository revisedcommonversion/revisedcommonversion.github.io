    <p class="ch-outline">Paul declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching the gospel, 1-6, and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same led to the praise of God's power, 7-11, to the benefit of the church, 12-15, and to the apostle's own eternal glory, 16-18.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not faint, 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 3 But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to those who are lost, 4 In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them. 5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined into our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels so that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us. 8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 10 Always carrying around in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our body. 11 For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake so that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 12 So then death works in us, but life in you.</p>

  <p>13 But having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, "<cite>I believed, and therefore, I have spoken,</cite>" we also believe, and therefore speak, 14 Knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also by Jesus and will present us with you. 15 For all things are for your sakes so that the abundant grace, through the thanksgiving of many, may abound to the glory of God.</p>

  <p>16 For which cause we do not faint, but though our outward man perishes, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 While we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>
