    <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Paul has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ by his exhortations, 1, 2, and by integrity of life, 3, and by patient enduring all kinds of affliction and disgrace for the gospel, 4-10. Of which he speaks the more boldly among them because his heart is open to them, 11-12, and he expects a similar affection from them again, 13; exhorting them to flee the society and pollutions of idolaters, as being themselves temples of the living God, 14-18.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And working together [with him], we entreat also that you do not receive the grace of God in vain.</p>

  <p>2 (For he says, "<cite>I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation I have succored you.</cite>" Behold, now is the accepted time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.)</p>

  <p>3 We give no offense in anything so that the ministry is not blamed, 4 But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; 6 By pureness, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by love unfeigned, 7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 8 By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers and true; 9 As unknown and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened and not killed; 10 As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing and possessing all things.</p>

  <p>11 O Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged. 12 You are not straitened in us, but you are restricted by your own inward affections. 13 Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as to my children), you also be enlarged.</p>

  <p>14 Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion has light with darkness? 15 And what concord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has he who believes with an infidel? 16 And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, as God has said, "'<cite>I will dwell in them</cite>' and walk in them. '<cite>And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</cite>'"</p>

  <p>17 Therefore, "<cite>Come out from among them and be separate,</cite>" says the Lord. "'<cite>Do not touch the unclean thing,</cite>' and I will receive you.</p>

  <p>18 And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters," says the Lord Almighty.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zmreSKBWXvllNRY9Mubh_svGjctqugmyWNelRsaNoUk/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Corinthians, Chapter 6</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1] - Text in square brackets added for implied meaning. From John Gill's Exposition: "Though the phrase, 'with him,' is not in the original text, where only one word is used, and may be rendered 'fellow workers,' or 'fellow laborers,' meaning with one another." Reference, 1st Corinthians 3:9.</p>
  <p>[v.2] - Quoting Isaiah 49:8 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.16a] - "For you are the temple of the living God" - Reference, 1st Corinthians 3:16, 6:19.</p>
  <p>[v.16b] - Quoting Ezekiel 37:27 (LXXâ€”paraphrased). See also, Exodus 29:45; Leviticus 26:12. Why Ezekiel? From John Calvin's Commentary: "On this account, I am of opinion that it is Ezekiel, rather than Moses, that is here quoted, because Ezekiel alludes at the same time to the type of the ark, and declares that it will have its fulfillment under the reign of Christ."</p>
  <p>[v.17] - Quoting Isaiah 52:11 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.18] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "This promise does not occur in one passage merely, but is repeated in various instances. Paul has added it with this view, that a recognition of the great honor to which God has exalted us, might be a motive to stir us up to a more ardent desire for holiness."</p>
