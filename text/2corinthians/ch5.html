    <p class="ch-outline">That in his assured hope of immortal glory, 1-8, and in expectation of it, and of the general judgment, Paul labors to keep a good conscience, 9-11; not that he may herein boast of himself, 12, 13, but as one who, having received life from Christ, endeavors to live as a new creature to Christ only, 14-17, and by his ministry of reconciliation, to reconcile others also in Christ to God, 18-21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our house which is from heaven, 3 Because, being clothed, we shall not be found naked. 4 For we who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, not because we wish to be unclothed, but clothed, so that mortality might be swallowed up in life. 5 Now he who has wrought us for this same thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>

  <p>6 Therefore, we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 7 For we walk by faith, not by sight. 8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. 9 Therefore also we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be accepted by him. 10 For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ so that each one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.</p>

  <p>11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 12 For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, so that you may have something to answer those who glory in appearance and not in heart. 13 For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God, or whether we are sober, it is for your cause. 14 For the love of Christ constrains us because we thus judge: that if one died for all, then all were dead, 15 And that he died for all so that those who live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him who died for them and rose again.</p>

  <p>16 Therefore, from now on we know no man according to the flesh, though indeed we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now from now on we no longer know him this way. 17 Therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new. 18 And all things are from God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation, 19 Namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</p>

  <p>20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God implored you by us. We pray you on behalf of Christ: be reconciled to God. 21 For he has made him who knew no sin to be sin for us so that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
