    <h3>Chapter 9</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Paul yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, he sent Titus and his brothers beforehand, 1-5. And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of seed, 6-9, which shall return a great increase to them, 10-12, and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings to God, 13-15.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 For as concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you. 2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to those of Macedonia that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has incited very many. 3 Yet I have sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this matter, so that, as I said, you may be ready, 4 Lest perhaps if those of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we (to not speak of you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 5 Therefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers that they would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised blessing, so that the same might be ready as a matter of blessing and not of extortion.</p>

  <p>6 But I say this, that he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully. 7 Let every man give according as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or by constraint, for God loves a cheerful giver. 8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you so that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,</p>

  <p>9 As it is written, "<cite>He has dispersed. He has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.</cite>"</p>

  <p>10 Now may he who ministers seed to the sower supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness, 11 Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God. 12 For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but is also abundant by many thanksgivings to God. 13 Because of the proof of this ministration, they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ and for your liberal contribution to them and to all men, 14 And by their prayer for you, who long after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. 15 Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://personal.onlyoffice.com/Products/Files/DocEditor.aspx?fileid=3895315&doc=ZjFuVUlSM1FlTWZYWnE1dnE1UzVITi9XV3VJeEVLL05xUVNHbnZ1WjFaTT0_IjM4OTUzMTUi0" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 2nd Corinthians, Chapter 9</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2] - "that Achaia was ready a year ago" - Reference, 2nd Corinthians 8:10.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Reference, Galatians 6:7-8.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "for God loves a cheerful giver" - This phrase is technically an Old Testament quote, but a quote from the Greek Septuagint in Proverbs 22:8. Here is a comparison of the Greek texts: "<span class="gr-heb">ἄνδρα ἱλαρὸν καὶ δότην εὐλογεῖ ὁ θεός</span>" (LXX); "<span class="gr-heb">ἱλαρὸν γὰρ δότην ἀγαπᾷ ὁ θεός</span>" (NT). Paul paraphrases a little here in this verse, but the LXX translates to something like, "God loves a cheerful and liberal man," which is very similar to "God loves a cheerful giver."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoting Psalm 112:9 (LXX).</p>
