  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "And at that time Michael shall stand up, the great prince who stands for the children of your people. And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, everyone who is found written in the book. 2 And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 3 And those who are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever. 4 But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."</p>

  <p>5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, there stood another two: one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 6 And someone said to the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, "How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?" 7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half of a time. And when he has made an end of dispersing the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. 8 And I heard, but I did not understand. Then I said, "O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?" 9 And he said, "Go your way Daniel. For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. 10 Many shall be purified, made white, and tried, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand. 11 And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away and the abomination that makes desolate is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. 12 Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. 13 But go your way until the end. For you shall rest and stand in your lot at the end of the days."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter begins with an account of a time of exceeding great trouble to the people of God, who are comforted with the consideration of Michael the great Prince being on their side, and with a promise of deliverance, with the resurrection of the dead, and the glorious state of wise and good men upon that (Daniel 12:1-3); and Daniel is ordered to shut up and seal the book of the prophecy until a time when it should be better understood (Daniel 12:4); next follows a question put by an angel to Christ, and his answer to it, with respect to the time of the fulfilment of those wonderful events (Daniel 12:5-7). Daniel, not understanding what he heard, asks what would be the end of those things (Daniel 12:8); in answer to which he is bid to be content with what he knew, no alteration would be among men, things would be neither better nor worse with them (Daniel 12:9-10); a time is fixed for the accomplishment of all (Daniel 12:11-12); and it is promised him that he should have rest after death, and rise again and have his lot and share with the blessed (Daniel 12:13).</p>
