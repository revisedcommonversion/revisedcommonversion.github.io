  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar, and the thing was true, but the appointed time was long. And he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</p>

  <p>2 In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. 3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, until three whole weeks were fulfilled. 4 And on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel, 5 I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz. 6 His body was also like beryl, his face as the appearance of lightning, his eyes as lamps of fire, his arms and his feet like the appearance of polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 7 And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. The men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 8 Therefore, I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my vigor was changed into corruption and I retained no strength. 9 Yet I heard the voice of his words. And when I heard the voice of his words, I was in a deep sleep on my face with my face toward the ground.</p>

  <p>10 And behold, a hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 11 And he said to me, "O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I am now sent to you." And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling. 12 Then he said to me, "Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words. 13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 14 Now I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days, for yet the vision is for many days."</p>

  <p>15 And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground and I became mute. 16 And behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke, and said to him who stood before me, "O my lord, by the vision my sorrows have turned upon me and I have retained no strength. 17 For how can this servant of my lord talk with my lord? For as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me."</p>

  <p>18 Then the one like the appearance of a man came back and touched me and strengthened me, 19 And said, "O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace be with you. Be strong. Indeed, be strong." And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." 20 Then he said, "Do you know for what cause I come to you? And now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. And when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Grecia shall come. 21 But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth. And there is no one who strengthens himself with me against these, except Michael your prince."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/daniel/MHC%20-%20Daniel%2C%20Chapter%2010.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Daniel, Chapter 10</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter is an introduction to the prophecies contained in the two following chapters. It begins with an account of Daniel’s mourning and fasting, preparatory to the vision he had (Daniel 10:1-3); and of the appearance of Christ to him, with the time and place of it, who is described by his clothing and the several parts of his body, which were very glorious, he appearing in a human form (Daniel 10:4-6); then follows an account of the effects it had upon him (Daniel 10:7-9); and of what encouragement and strength he received from him, by words and touches, to listen to what he said, and to expect a discovery and an understanding of things of moment and importance, which should be in future times (Daniel 10:10-21).</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Reference, Revelation 19:6.</p>
  <p>[v.21] - "scripture" - From John Gill's Exposition: "Not in the written word, though there are many things relating to what should befall the Jews in the latter day, especially in Deuteronomy 28:1 but in the decrees and purposes of God, which are sometimes signified by a book, and things written in it; because so particular and distinct, and so sure and certain, and which will be most truly, infallibly, and punctually performed: these are 'noted', marked, engraven, in the eternal mind of God; they are 'in writing', and they are 'truth', as it may be rendered, since there is a distinguishing accent between 'Scripture' and 'truth': they are written in the book of God's decrees, and are his true and faithful words and sayings, and will most surely be accomplished: now these are the deep things of God, which angels themselves know nothing of, till they are revealed unto them: the angel here having a revelation of such of them as concerned the future monarchies of the earth, and the case of the Jews under them, promises to show them to Daniel; which was the work he was appointed to do."</p>
