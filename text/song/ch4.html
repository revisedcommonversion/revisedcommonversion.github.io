  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/song-of-solomon/MHC%20-%20Song%20of%20Solomon%2C%20Chapter%204.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Song of Solomon, Chapter 4</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter is contained a large commendation of the church’s beauty by Christ: first, more particularly, by an enumeration of several parts, as her eyes, hair, teeth, lips, temples, neck, and breasts (Song of Solomon 4:1-5); and more generally (Song of Solomon 4:7); And having observed where he himself was determined to go, he invites her to go with him, which he enforces, partly from the danger she was exposed to where she was (Song of Solomon 4:6,8); and partly from the comeliness of her person and graces in his esteem, with which he was ravished, and therefore was extremely desirous of her company (Song of Solomon 4:9-11); And then enters into some new descriptions of her, as a garden and orchard, as a spring and fountain (Song of Solomon 4:12-14); all which she makes to be owing to him (Song of Solomon 4:15). And the chapter is closed with an order from Christ to the winds to blow on his garden and cause the spices of it to flow out, and with an invitation of the church to Christ, to come into his garden and relax there (Song of Solomon 4:16).</p>
