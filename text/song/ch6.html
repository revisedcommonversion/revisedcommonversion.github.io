  <p>1 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] Where has your beloved gone, O fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned aside so that we may seek him with you?</p>

  <p>2 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] My beloved has gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.</p>

  <p>3 I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine. He feeds among the lilies.</p>

  <p>4 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.</p>

  <p>5 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</p>

  <p>6 Your teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, of which every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.</p>

  <p>7 As a piece of pomegranate are your temples within your locks.</p>

  <p>8 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number.</p>

  <p>9 My dove, my undefiled is but one. She is the only one of her mother. She is the choice one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her and blessed her, even the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>

  <p>10 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?</p>

  <p>11 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</p>

  <p>12 Before I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</p>

  <p>13 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] Return, return, O Shulamite. Return, return, so that we may look upon you. [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] Why should you gaze at the Shulamite, as at the company of two armies?</p>
