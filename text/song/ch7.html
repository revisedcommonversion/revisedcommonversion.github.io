  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! The joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.</p>

  <p>2 Your navel is like a round goblet which does not lack liquor. Your belly is like a heap of wheat surrounded by lilies.</p>

  <p>3 Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</p>

  <p>4 Your neck is as a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the fish-pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</p>

  <p>5 Your head upon you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple. The king is held in the galleries.</p>

  <p>6 How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, for delights!</p>

  <p>7 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts like clusters of grapes.</p>

  <p>8 I said, "I will go up to the palm tree. I will take hold of its boughs." Now also your breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples.</p>

  <p>9 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] And the roof of your mouth shall be like the best wine for my beloved that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those who are asleep to speak.</p>

  <p>10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</p>

  <p>11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field. Let us lodge in the villages.</p>

  <p>12 Let us get up early to the vineyards. Let us see if the vine flourishes, whether the tender grape appears and the pomegranates bud forth. There I will give you my love.</p>

  <p>13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Christ gives a fresh commendation of the beauty of his church in a different order and method than before, beginning with her “feet,” and then rising upward to the “hair” of her head and the roof of her mouth (Song of Solomon 7:1-9); And then the church asserts her interest in him, and his desire toward her (Song of Solomon 7:10); and invites him to go with her into the fields, villages, and vineyards, and offers various reasons by which she urges him to comply with her invitation (Song of Solomon 7:11-13).</p>
