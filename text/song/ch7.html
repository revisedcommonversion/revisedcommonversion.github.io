  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/song-of-solomon/MHC%20-%20Song%20of%20Solomon%2C%20Chapter%207.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Song of Solomon, Chapter 7</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Christ gives a fresh commendation of the beauty of his church in a different order and method than before, beginning with her “feet,” and then rising upward to the “hair” of her head and the roof of her mouth (Song of Solomon 7:1-9); And then the church asserts her interest in him, and his desire toward her (Song of Solomon 7:10); and invites him to go with her into the fields, villages, and vineyards, and offers various reasons by which she urges him to comply with her invitation (Song of Solomon 7:11-13).</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "like the best wine—" - Here, the Lady interrupts the Gentleman and finishes his sentence. That is why this verse is broken up as it is.</p>
