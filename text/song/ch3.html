  <p>[<span class="it">Lady:</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sought him, but I did not find him.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; I will rise now and go throughout the city in the streets, and in the broad ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will seek him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sought him, but I did not find him.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; The watchmen who go throughout the city found me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to whom I said, "Did you see him whom my soul loves?"</p>

    <p>4&emsp; It was but a little that I passed from them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I found him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I held him and would not let him go<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I had brought him into my mother's house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and into the chamber of her who conceived me.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the gazelles and by the does of the field<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you do not stir up or awake my love<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until he pleases.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Who is this who comes out of the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like pillars of smoke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with all powders of the merchant?</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Behold his bed, which is Solomon's.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sixty valiant men are around it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the valiant of Israel.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; They all hold swords, being expert in war.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every man has his sword upon his thigh<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of fear in the night.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; King Solomon made himself a chariot<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the wood of Lebanon.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;He made its pillars of silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />its back of gold, its seat of purple,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />its midst being covered with love<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the daughters of Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the crown with which his mother crowned him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the day of his espousals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter an account is given of an adventure of the church in quest of her beloved, of the time when, places where, and the persons of whom she sought him, and of her success upon the whole, with a charge she give to the daughters of Jerusalem (Song of Solomon 3:1-5); by whom she is commended (Song of Solomon 3:6); and then Christ, her beloved, is described by her, by his bed and the guard about it (Song of Solomon 3:7-8); by the chariot he rode in (Song of Solomon 3:9-10); and by the crown he wore on his coronation day (Song of Solomon 3:11).</p>
