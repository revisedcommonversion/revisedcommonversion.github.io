    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sought him, but I did not find him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> I will rise now and go throughout the city in the streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the broad ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will seek him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I sought him, but I did not find him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The watchmen who go throughout the city found me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to whom I said, "Did you see him whom my soul loves?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> It was but a little that I passed from them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I found him whom my soul loves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I held him and would not let him go<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I had brought him into my mother's house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and into the chamber of her who conceived me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the gazelles and by the does of the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that you do not stir up or awake my love<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until he pleases.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Who is this who comes out of the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />like pillars of smoke,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with all powders of the merchant?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Behold his bed, which is Solomon's.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sixty valiant men are around it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the valiant of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They all hold swords, being expert in war.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Every man has his sword upon his thigh<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of fear in the night.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> King Solomon made himself a chariot<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the wood of Lebanon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the crown with which his mother crowned him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the day of his espousals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>

  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter an account is given of an adventure of the church in quest of her beloved, of the time when, places where, and the persons of whom she sought him, and of her success upon the whole, with a charge she give to the daughters of Jerusalem (Song of Solomon 3:1-5); by whom she is commended (Song of Solomon 3:6); and then Christ, her beloved, is described by her, by his bed and the guard about it (Song of Solomon 3:7-8); by the chariot he rode in (Song of Solomon 3:9-10); and by the crown he wore on his coronation day (Song of Solomon 3:11).</p>
