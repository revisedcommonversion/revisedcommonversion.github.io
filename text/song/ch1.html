  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/song-of-solomon/MHC%20-%20Song%20of%20Solomon%2C%20Chapter%201.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Song of Solomon, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter, after the general title of the book (Song of Solomon 1:1), the church expresses her strong desires and most ardent wishes for some fresh discoveries of the love of Christ to her and for communion with him, having tasted of his love, smelt a sweet savour in his grace, and enjoyed fellowship with him in his house (Song of Solomon 1:2-4). She observes her blackness and uncomeliness in herself, the trials and afflictions she met with from others, and her carelessness and negligence of her own affairs (Song of Solomon 1:5-6); and entreats her beloved to direct her where she might meet with him, feeding his flocks, and giving them rest, to which he returns a kind and gracious answer, gives her proper instructions where to find him (Song of Solomon 1:7,8), and commends her beauty, sets forth her amiableness and loveliness, by various metaphors, and makes promises of more grace and good things to her (Song of Solomon 1:9-11). And then she declares what a value she had for Christ, her beloved, and how precious he was to her, like a bundle of myrrh and a cluster of camphire (Song of Solomon 1:12-14). Christ again praises her beauty, and particularly takes notice of her eyes and her modest look (Song of Solomon 1:15); and she returns the encomium back to him and expresses her pleasure and satisfaction in the house he had built for her and the furniture of it (Song of Solomon 1:16-17).</p>
