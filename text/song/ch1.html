  <p>1 [<span class="it">The song of songs, which is Solomon's.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine.</p>

  <p>3 Because of the savor of your good ointments, your name is as ointment poured forth; therefore, the virgins love you.</p>

  <p>4 Draw me. We will run after you. The king has brought me into his chambers. [<span class="it">Others:</span>] We will be glad and rejoice in you. We will remember your love more than wine. The upright love you.</p>

  <p>5 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I am black, but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>

  <p>6 Do not look upon me because I am black, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's children were angry with me. They made me the keeper of the vineyards, but I have not kept my own vineyard.</p>

  <p>7 Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed, where you make your flock to rest at noon. For why should I be as one who turns aside by the flocks of your companions?</p>

  <p>8 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] If you do not know, O fairest among women, go forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed your kids beside the shepherds' tents.</p>

  <p>9 I have compared you, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</p>

  <p>10 Your cheeks are beautiful with rows of jewels, your neck with chains of gold.</p>

  <p>11 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] We will make for you borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>

  <p>12 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] While the king sits at his table, my spikenard sends forth its smell.</p>

  <p>13 A bundle of myrrh is my well beloved to me. He shall lie all night between my breasts.</p>

  <p>14 My beloved is to me as a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of En-gedi.</p>

  <p>15 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] Behold, you are fair, my love. Behold, you are fair. You have doves' eyes.</p>

  <p>16 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] Behold, you are fair, my beloved, even pleasant. Also our bed is green.</p>

  <p>17 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] The beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir.</p>
