  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/song-of-solomon/MHC%20-%20Song%20of%20Solomon%2C%20Chapter%205.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Song of Solomon, Chapter 5</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter begins with Christ’s answer to the church’s request, in which he informs her that he had come into his garden, as she desired, and gives an account of what he had done there, and kindly invites his dear friends to feast with him there (Song of Solomon 5:1); Then she relates her case and circumstances, which followed upon this, her sleepy frame and ungrateful carriage to her beloved, which he resenting, withdrew from her and this gave her sensible pain (Song of Solomon 5:2-6); what treatment she met with from the watchmen, her charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, and the questions they asked about her beloved (Song of Solomon 5:7-9); which put her upon giving a large description of him by each of his parts, head, hair, etc. (Song of Solomon 5:10-15). And the chapter is concluded with a general commendation of him and his loveliness, and a claim of interest in him (Song of Solomon 5:16).</p>
