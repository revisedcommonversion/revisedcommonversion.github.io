  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] I have come into my garden, my sister, my spouse. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey. I have drank my wine with my milk. [<span class="it">Others:</span>] Eat, O friends. Drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.</p>

  <p>2 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I sleep, but my heart wakes. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks, saying, "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled, for my head is filled with dew and my locks with the drops of the night."</p>

  <p>3 I have put off my coat. How shall I put it on? I have washed my feet. How shall I defile them?</p>

  <p>4 My beloved put his hand in by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.</p>

  <p>5 I rose up to open to my beloved. And my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock.</p>

  <p>6 I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone. My soul failed when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him. I called him, but he gave me no answer.</p>

  <p>7 The watchmen who went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me. The keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</p>

  <p>8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am sick with love.</p>

  <p>9 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] What is your beloved more than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved that you charge us so?</p>

  <p>10 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] My beloved is white and ruddy, the chief among ten thousand.</p>

  <p>11 His head is as the most fine gold. His locks are bushy and black as a raven.</p>

  <p>12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk and set in fullness.</p>

  <p>13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers. His lips are like lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh.</p>

  <p>14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl. His belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</p>

  <p>15 His legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold. His countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</p>

  <p>16 His mouth is most sweet. Indeed, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
