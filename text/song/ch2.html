  <p>1 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.</p>

  <p>2 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>

  <p>3 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>

  <p>4 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>

  <p>5 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick with love.</p>

  <p>6 His left hand is under my head and his right hand embraces me.</p>

  <p>7 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that you do not stir or awake my love until he pleases.</p>

  <p>8 The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>

  <p>9 My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall. He looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.</p>

  <p>10 My beloved spoke and said to me, "Rise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>

  <p>11 For behold, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.</p>

  <p>12 The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing of birds has come, and the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land.</p>

  <p>13 The fig-tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away."</p>

  <p>14 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the precipice, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice. For your voice is sweet and your countenance is beautiful.</p>

  <p>15 Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.</p>

  <p>16 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] My beloved is mine and I am his. He feeds among the lilies.</p>

  <p>17 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</p>
