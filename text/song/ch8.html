  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] O that you were as my brother who was nourished at the breasts of my mother! When I should find you outside, I would kiss you. Indeed, I should not be despised.</p>

  <p>2 I would lead you and bring you into my mother's house, who would instruct me. I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>

  <p>3 His left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace me.</p>

  <p>4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you do not stir or awake my love until he pleases.</p>

  <p>5 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] Who is this who comes up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved? [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I raised you up under the apple-tree. There your mother brought you forth. There she brought you forth who bore you.</p>

  <p>6 Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm. For love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as the grave. Its coals are coals of fire which has a most vehement flame.</p>

  <p>7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be despised.</p>

  <p>8 [<span class="it">Others:</span>] We have a little sister and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is spoken for?</p>

  <p>9 If she is a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver. And if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</p>

  <p>10 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] I am a wall and my breasts like towers. Then I was in his eyes as one who found favor.</p>

  <p>11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon. He lent out the vineyard to keepers. Each for its fruit was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</p>

  <p>12 My vineyard which is mine is before me. You, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those who keep its fruit, two hundred.</p>

  <p>13 [<span class="it">Gentleman:</span>] You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice. Cause me to hear it.</p>

  <p>14 [<span class="it">Lady:</span>] Make haste, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p>
