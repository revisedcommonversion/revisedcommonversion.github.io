  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/song-of-solomon/MHC%20-%20Song%20of%20Solomon%2C%20Chapter%208.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Song of Solomon, Chapter 8</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter begins with an ardent wish of the church for a free and intimate converse with Christ, declaring what she would do to him and for him, should she have such an interview with him (Song of Solomon 8:1-2); what familiarity should be between them (Song of Solomon 8:3); charging the daughters of Jerusalem not to give him any disturbance (Song of Solomon 8:4); upon which they inquire who she was who was in such a posture they saw her in (Song of Solomon 8:5); when the church, instead of giving them an answer, says some things concerning her beloved, on whom they saw her leaning, and makes some requests to him for more nearness to him and manifestations of his love to her, urged from the strength her love and affections to him, which was invincible (Song of Solomon 8:6-7). Next follows a speech of the church about her little sister, expressing a concern for her and what she would do to her and with her (Song of Solomon 8:8-9); and the answer of the little sister declaring what she was and what she enjoyed (Song of Solomon 8:10); then the words of the church again, concerning her husband’s vineyard, the place, keepers, and profit of it (Song of Solomon 8:11-12). And the chapter, and with it the Song, is concluded with a request of Christ to the church that he might hear her voice (Song of Solomon 8:13); and with a petition of hers to him that he would come quickly to her (Song of Solomon 8:14).</p>
