  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>

  <p>2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 3 And said to him, "Are you he who should come, or do we look for another?" 4 Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Go and report to John those things which you hear and see:</span> 5 <span class="woc">'<cite>The blind receive their sight,</cite>' '<cite>the lame walk,</cite>' the lepers are cleansed, '<cite>the deaf hear,</cite>' the dead are raised, and '<cite>the poor have the gospel preached to them.</cite>'</span> 6 <span class="woc">And blessed is he to whom I shall not be the cause of his falling into sin.</span>"</p>

  <p>7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, "<span class="woc">What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span> 8 <span class="woc">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</span> 9 <span class="woc">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</span></p>

  <p>10 "<span class="woc">For this is he concerning whom it is written, '<cite>Behold, I send my messenger before your face who shall prepare your way before you.</cite>'</span></p>

  <p>11 "<span class="woc">Truly, I say to you, among those who are born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist, yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he is.</span> 12 <span class="woc">And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</span> 13 <span class="woc">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> 14 <span class="woc">And if you will receive it, this is Elijah who was to come.</span> 15 <span class="woc">He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p>

  <p>16 "<span class="woc">But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets and calling to their fellows,</span> 17 <span class="woc">And saying, 'We have piped to you, and you have not danced. We have mourned to you, and you have not lamented.'</span> 18 <span class="woc">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'</span> 19 <span class="woc">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is justified by her children.</span>"</p>

  <p>20 Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done because they did not repent. 21 "<span class="woc">Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> 22 <span class="woc">But I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</span> 23 <span class="woc">And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell. For if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> 24 <span class="woc">But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.</span>"</p>

  <p>25 At that time Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babies.</span> 26 <span class="woc">Indeed, Father, for thus it seemed good in your sight.</span> 27 <span class="woc">All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows the Son, except the Father, neither does any man know the Father, except the Son and he to whomever the Son will reveal him.</span></p>

  <p>28 "<span class="woc">Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> 29 <span class="woc">Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. For I am meek and lowly in heart, '<cite>and you shall find rest for your souls.</cite>'</span> 30 <span class="woc">For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</span>"</p>
