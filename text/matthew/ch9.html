  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he entered into a boat, passed over, and came into his own city. 2 And behold, they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. And Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "<span class="woc">Son, be of good cheer. Your sins are forgiven.</span>" 3 And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, "This man blasphemes." 4 And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "<span class="woc">Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> 5 <span class="woc">For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, and walk'?</span> 6 <span class="woc">But so that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins</span>"—then he says to the paralytic—"<span class="woc">Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</span>" 7 And he arose and departed to his house. 8 But when the multitude saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men.</p>

  <p>9 And as Jesus was passing from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom. And he says to him, "<span class="woc">Follow me.</span>" And he arose and followed him.</p>

  <p>10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. 11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, "Why does your Master eat with tax collectors and sinners?" 12 But when Jesus heard that, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Those who are in health do not need a physician, but those who are sick do.</span> 13 <span class="woc">But go and learn what this means: '<cite>I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</cite>' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span>"</p>

  <p>14 Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?" 15 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast.</span> 16 <span class="woc">No man puts a patch of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up, takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.</span> 17 <span class="woc">Men do not put new wine into old bottles, or else the bottles break, the wine runs out, and the bottles perish. But they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved.</span>"</p>

  <p>18 While he was speaking these things to them, behold, a certain ruler came and worshiped him, saying, "My daughter is even now dead. But come and lay your hand upon her and she will live." 19 And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.</p>

  <p>20 (And behold, a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment. 21 For she said within herself, "If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." 22 But Jesus turned himself around, and when he saw her, he said, "<span class="woc">Daughter, be of good comfort. Your faith has made you whole.</span>" And the woman was made whole from that hour.)</p>

  <p>23 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, 24 He said to them, "<span class="woc">Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleeps.</span>" And they derided him. 25 But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 26 And the fame of this went abroad into all that land.</p>

  <p>27 And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us." 28 And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. And Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">Do you believe that I am able to do this?</span>" They said to him, "Yes, Lord." 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, "<span class="woc">According to your faith, it shall be done to you.</span>" 30 Then their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, "<span class="woc">See that no man knows it.</span>" 31 But they, when they had departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.</p>

  <p>32 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a mute man possessed with a demon. 33 And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, "Nothing has ever been seen like this in Israel." 34 But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons through the prince of the demons."</p>

  <p>35 And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</p>

  <p>36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. 37 Then he says to his disciples, "<span class="woc">The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.</span> 38 <span class="woc">Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.</span>"</p>
