  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 "<span class="woc">Do not judge so that you may not be judged.</span> 2 <span class="woc">For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged. And the measure which you give shall be measured back to you.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but do not consider the beam that is in your own eye?</span> 4 <span class="woc">Or how will you say to your brother, 'Let me pull the mote out of your eye,' and behold, a beam is in your own eye?</span> 5 <span class="woc">You hypocrite, first cast the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to cast the mote out of your brother's eye.</span></p>

  <p>6 "<span class="woc">Do not give that which is holy to dogs, neither cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.</span></p>

  <p>7 "<span class="woc">Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door shall be opened to you.</span> 8 <span class="woc">For everyone who asks, receives, and he who seeks, finds, and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.</span> 9 <span class="woc">Or what man is there of you, who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone,</span> 10 <span class="woc">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?</span> 11 <span class="woc">If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?</span></p>

  <p>12 "<span class="woc">Therefore, in all things whatever you wish that men should do to you, do even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</span></p>

  <p>13 "<span class="woc">Enter in at the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it.</span> 14 <span class="woc">But the gate is narrow and the way is confined which leads to life, and there are few who find it.</span></p>

  <p>15 "<span class="woc">Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span> 16 <span class="woc">You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> 17 <span class="woc">Likewise, every good tree brings forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.</span> 18 <span class="woc">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> 19 <span class="woc">Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</span> 20 <span class="woc">Therefore, you shall know them by their fruits.</span></p>

  <p>21 "<span class="woc">Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> 22 <span class="woc">Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name done many wonderful works?'</span> 23 <span class="woc">And then I will profess to them, 'I never knew you. "<cite>Depart from me, you who work iniquity.</cite>"'</span></p>

  <p>24 "<span class="woc">Therefore, whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house upon a rock.</span> 25 <span class="woc">And the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it did not fall, for it was founded upon a rock.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And everyone who hears these sayings of mine and does not do them, shall be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.</span> 27 <span class="woc">And the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.</span>"</p>

  <p>28 And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine, 29 For he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.</p>
