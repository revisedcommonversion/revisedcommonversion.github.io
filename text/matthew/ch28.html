    <h3>Chapter 28</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Christ's resurrection is declared by an angel to the women, 1-8. He himself appears to them, 9, 10. The chief priests give the soldiers money to say that he was stolen out of his sepulcher, 11-15. Christ appears to his disciples, 16, 17, and sends them to baptize and teach all nations, 18-20.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 In the evening of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulcher. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 3 His countenance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow. 4 And for fear of him the keepers trembled and became as dead men. 5 And the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not fear, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 6 He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 7 And go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee. There you shall see him.' Behold, I have told you."</p>

  <p>8 And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy and ran to bring word to his disciples. 9 And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "<span class="woc">All hail.</span>" And they came, held him by the feet, and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</span>"</p>

  <p>11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city and showed to the chief priests all the things that had been done. 12 And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 Saying, "Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept. 14 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and secure you." 15 So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>

  <p>16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee to a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 17 And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. 18 And Jesus came, and spoke to them, saying, "<span class="woc">All power is given to me in heaven and upon earth.</span> 19 <span class="woc">Therefore, go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</span> 20 <span class="woc">Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.</span>" Amen.</p>

  <p>[v.1a] - "In the evening of the sabbath" - From the Latin phrase, "vespere sabbati." Originally written as, "In the end of the sabbath..." That coupled with the following clause, "...as it began to dawn..." indicates that this event took place after the closing of the Sabbath day. During those times, the day ended in the evening and began after sunset.</p>
