  <p>1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan. 2 And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.</p>

  <p>3 The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?" 4 And he answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Have you not read, that he who made them from the beginning '<cite>made them male and female,</cite>'</span> 5 <span class="woc">And said, '<cite>For this cause a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and the two of them shall be one flesh</cite>'?</span> 6 <span class="woc">Therefore, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, do not let man tear apart.</span>" 7 They say to him, "Why then did Moses command to '<cite>give a writing of divorcement and to put her away</cite>'?" 8 He says to them, "<span class="woc">Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> 9 <span class="woc">And I say to you, that whoever puts away his wife, except for lewdness, and marries another, commits adultery. And whoever marries her who is put away, commits adultery.</span>"</p>

  <p>10 His disciples say to him, "If that is the case of the man with his wife, it is not good to marry." 11 But he said to them, "<span class="woc">All men cannot receive this saying, except those to whom it is given.</span> 12 <span class="woc">For there are some eunuchs who were thus born from their mothers womb, there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.</span>"</p>

  <p>13 Then little children were brought to him so that he might put his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. 14 But Jesus said, "<span class="woc">Allow little children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span>" 15 And he laid his hands on them and departed from there.</p>

  <p>16 And behold, someone came and said to him, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do so that I may have eternal life?" 17 And he said to him, "<span class="woc">Why do you call me good? There is no one good but one: God. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.</span>" 18 He says to him, "Which?" Jesus said, "<span class="woc">'<cite>You shall not murder,</cite>' '<cite>You shall not commit adultery,</cite>' '<cite>You shall not steal,</cite>' '<cite>You shall not bear false witness,</cite>'</span> 19 <span class="woc">'<cite>Honor your father and your mother,</cite>' and, '<cite>You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</cite>'</span>" 20 The young man says to him, "All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I yet lack?" 21 Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">If you wish to be perfect, go and sell what you have, give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.</span>" 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</p>

  <p>23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of heaven with difficulty.</span> 24 <span class="woc">And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>" 25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, "Who then can be saved?" 26 But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, "<span class="woc">With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.</span>"</p>

  <p>27 Then Peter answered, and said to him, "Behold, we have forsaken all and followed you. What therefore shall we have?" 28 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man sits on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> 29 <span class="woc">And everyone who has forsaken houses, brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive one hundred-fold and shall inherit everlasting life.</span> 30 <span class="woc">But many who are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.</span>"</p>
