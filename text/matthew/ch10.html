  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And when he had called his twelve disciples to him, he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</p>

  <p>2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; 3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was Thaddeus; 4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>

  <p>5 These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, "<span class="woc">Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans.</span> 6 <span class="woc">But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span> 7 <span class="woc">And as you go, proclaim, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'</span> 8 <span class="woc">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</span> 9 <span class="woc">Provide neither gold, silver, nor brass in your purses,</span> 10 <span class="woc">Nor bag for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor a staff, for the workman is worthy of his food.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And into whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy and abide there until you go from there.</span> 12 <span class="woc">And when you come into a house, salute it.</span> 13 <span class="woc">And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> 14 <span class="woc">And whoever does not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart from that house, or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span> 15 <span class="woc">Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.</span></p>

  <p>16 "<span class="woc">Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</span> 17 <span class="woc">But beware of men, for they will deliver you to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues.</span> 18 <span class="woc">And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</span> 19 <span class="woc">But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious of how or what you shall speak, for it shall be given to you in that same hour what you shall speak.</span> 20 <span class="woc">For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span></p>

  <p>21 "<span class="woc">And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child. And the children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.</span> 22 <span class="woc">And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span></p>

  <p>23 "<span class="woc">But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another. For truly I say to you, you shall not have gone over the cities of Israel until the Son of man has come.</span></p>

  <p>24 "<span class="woc">The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the servant above his lord.</span> 25 <span class="woc">It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call them of his household?</span></p>

  <p>26 "<span class="woc">Do not fear them therefore, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, or hid that shall not be known.</span> 27 <span class="woc">What I tell you in darkness, speak in the light. And what you hear in the ear, publish it upon the house-tops.</span> 28 <span class="woc">And do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> 29 <span class="woc">Are two sparrows not sold for an assarion? And not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father.</span> 30 <span class="woc">But every hair on your head has been numbered.</span> 31 <span class="woc">Do not fear therefore. You are of more value than many sparrows.</span></p>

  <p>32 "<span class="woc">Whoever therefore confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.</span> 33 <span class="woc">But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</span></p>

  <p>34 "<span class="woc">Do not think that I have come to send peace on earth. I did not come to send peace, but a sword.</span> 35 <span class="woc">For I have come to '<cite>set a man at variance against his father, the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</cite>'</span> 36 <span class="woc">And '<cite>a man's foes will be those of his own household.</cite>'</span></p>

  <p>37 "<span class="woc">He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</span> 38 <span class="woc">And he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</span> 39 <span class="woc">He who finds his life shall lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake shall find it.</span></p>

  <p>40 "<span class="woc">He who receives you, receives me, and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.</span> 41 <span class="woc">He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward, and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</span> 42 <span class="woc">And whoever gives a drink to one of these little ones, merely a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, truly, I say to you, he shall in no way lose his reward.</span>"</p>
