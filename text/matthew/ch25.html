  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 "<span class="woc">Then the kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</span> 2 <span class="woc">And five of them were wise and five were foolish.</span> 3 <span class="woc">Those who were foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them.</span> 4 <span class="woc">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</span> 5 <span class="woc">While the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</span> 6 <span class="woc">And at midnight there was a cry made, 'Behold, the bridegroom comes. Go out to meet him.'</span> 7 <span class="woc">Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</span> 8 <span class="woc">And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.'</span> 9 <span class="woc">But the wise answered, saying, 'Not so, lest there not be enough for us and you. But rather go to those who sell and buy some for yourselves.'</span> 10 <span class="woc">And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the marriage. Then the door was shut.</span> 11 <span class="woc">Afterward, the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.'</span> 12 <span class="woc">But he answered and said, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'</span> 13 <span class="woc">Therefore, watch, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man comes.</span></p>

  <p>14 "<span class="woc">For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.</span> 15 <span class="woc">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. Then he immediately took his journey.</span> 16 <span class="woc">Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with the same and gained another five talents.</span> 17 <span class="woc">And likewise, he who had received two, he also gained another two.</span> 18 <span class="woc">But he who had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord's money.</span></p>

  <p>19 "<span class="woc">After a long time, the lord of those servants comes and settles accounts with them.</span> 20 <span class="woc">And he who had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, 'Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained besides them five more talents.'</span> 21 <span class="woc">His lord said to him, 'Well done you good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span></p>

  <p>22 "<span class="woc">He also who had received two talents came, and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained two other talents besides them.'</span> 23 <span class="woc">His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span></p>

  <p>24 "<span class="woc">Then he who had received the one talent came, and said, 'Lord, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not strewed.</span> 25 <span class="woc">I was afraid and went and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, there you have what is yours.'</span></p>

  <p>26 "<span class="woc">His lord answered and said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not strewed.</span> 27 <span class="woc">You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with interest.</span> 28 <span class="woc">Therefore, take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents.</span></p>

  <p>29 <span class="woc">'For to everyone who has shall be given, and he shall have abundance. But from him who does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away.</span> 30 <span class="woc">And cast the unprofitable servant into utter darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</span></p>

  <p>31 "<span class="woc">When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, he will sit upon the throne of his glory.</span> 32 <span class="woc">And before him all nations shall be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.</span> 33 <span class="woc">And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span></p>

  <p>34 "<span class="woc">Then the King will say to those on his right hand, 'Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span> 35 <span class="woc">For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.</span> 36 <span class="woc">I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.'</span> 37 <span class="woc">Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</span> 38 <span class="woc">When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you?</span> 39 <span class="woc">Or when did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'</span> 40 <span class="woc">And the King will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, since you have done it to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you have done it to me.'</span></p>

  <p>41 "<span class="woc">Then he will also say to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> 42 <span class="woc">For I was hungry and you gave me no food. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink.</span> 43 <span class="woc">I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.'</span> 44 <span class="woc">Then they will also answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?'</span> 45 <span class="woc">Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, since you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.'</span> 46 <span class="woc">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.</span>"</p>
