    <h3>Chapter 20</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Christ, by the similitude of the laborers in the vineyard, shows that God is debtor to no man, 1-16; foretells his passion, 17-19; by answering the mother of Zebedee's children, teaches his disciples to be lowly, 20-28; and gives two blind men their sight, 29-34.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 "<span class="woc">For the kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard.</span> 2 <span class="woc">And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market-place,</span> 4 <span class="woc">And said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right, I will give you.' And they departed.</span> 5 <span class="woc">Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.</span> 6 <span class="woc">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and says to them, 'Why do you stand here all day idle?'</span> 7 <span class="woc">They say to him, 'Because no man has hired us.' He says to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right, that you shall receive.'</span></p>

  <p>8 "<span class="woc">So when evening had come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, 'Call the laborers and give them their hire, beginning from the last to the first.'</span> 9 <span class="woc">And when those who were hired about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.</span> 10 <span class="woc">But when the first came, they supposed that they should receive more, and they likewise each received a denarius.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And when they had received it, they murmured against the master of the house,</span> 12 <span class="woc">Saying, 'These last have wrought but one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.'</span> 13 <span class="woc">But he answered one of them, and said, 'Friend, I do you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> 14 <span class="woc">Take that which is yours and depart. I will give to this last, even as to you.</span> 15 <span class="woc">Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own? Is your eye evil because I am good?'</span> 16 <span class="woc">So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.</span>"</p>

  <p>17 And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples separately in the way, and said to them, 18 "<span class="woc">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,</span> 19 <span class="woc">And will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, scourge, and crucify him. And on the third day he will rise again.</span>"</p>

  <p>20 Then the mother of Zebedee's children came to him, with her sons, worshiping him and desiring a certain thing of him. 21 And he said to her, "<span class="woc">What do you wish?</span>" She says to him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on your right hand and the other on your left in your kingdom." 22 But Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span>" They say to him, "We are able." 23 And he says to them, "<span class="woc">You shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.</span>"</p>

  <p>24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them to him, and said, "<span class="woc">You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and those who are great exercise authority upon them.</span> 26 <span class="woc">But it shall not be so among you. But whoever wishes to be great among you, let him be your minister,</span> 27 <span class="woc">And whoever wishes to be chief among you, let him be your servant,</span> 28 <span class="woc">Even as the Son of man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.</span>"</p>

  <p>29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. 30 And behold, two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David." 31 And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace, but they cried the more, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, son of David." 32 And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, "<span class="woc">What do you wish that I shall do to you?</span>" 33 They say to him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened." 34 So Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him.</p>
