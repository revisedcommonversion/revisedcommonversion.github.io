    <p class="ch-outline">The genealogy of Christ from Abraham to Joseph, 1-17. He is miraculously conceived through the Holy Spirit by the virgin Mary when she was espoused to Joseph, 18.

  <p>1 [<span class="it">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, Jacob begot Judah and his brothers, 3 Judah begot Pharez and Zarah by Tamar, Pharez begot Hezron, Hezron begot Ram, 4 Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, Nahshon begot Salmon, 5 Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse, 6 Jesse begot David the king, David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah, 7 Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, Abijah begot Asa, 8 Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, Joram begot Uzziah, 9 Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, Ahaz begot Hezekiah, 10 Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, Amon begot Josiah, 11 And Josiah begot Jechoniah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</p>

  <p>12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechoniah begot Shealtiel, Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel, 13 Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, Eliakim begot Azor, 14 Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, Achim begot Eliud, 15 Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, Matthan begot Jacob, 16 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</p>

  <p>17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</p>

  <p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit. 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately. 20 But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take for yourself Mary as your wife. For that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins." 22 Now all this was done so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, 23 "<cite>Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,</cite>" which being interpreted is, "God with us." 24 Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took for himself his wife, 25 And did not know her until she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name JESUS.</p>
