  <p>1 [<span class="it">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, Jacob begot Judah and his brothers, 3 Judah begot Phares and Zara by Thamar, Phares begot Esrom, Esrom begot Aram, 4 Aram begot Aminadab, Aminadab begot Naasson, Naasson begot Salmon, 5 Salmon begot Booz by Rachab, Booz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse, 6 Jesse begot David the king, David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah, 7 Solomon begot Roboam, Roboam begot Abia, Abia begot Asa, 8 Asa begot Josaphat, Josaphat begot Joram, Joram begot Ozias, 9 Ozias begot Joatham, Joatham begot Achaz, Achaz begot Ezekias, 10 Ezekias begot Manasses, Manasses begot Amon, Amon begot Josias, 11 And Josias begot Jechonias and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</p>

  <p>12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begot Salathiel, Salathiel begot Zorobabel, 13 Zorobabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, Eliakim begot Azor, 14 Azor begot Sadoc, Sadoc begot Achim, Achim begot Eliud, 15 Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, Matthan begot Jacob, 16 And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</p>

  <p>17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</p>

  <p>18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit. 19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately. 20 But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take for yourself Mary as your wife. For that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins." 22 Now all this was done so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, 23 "<cite>Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,</cite>" which being interpreted is, "God with us." 24 Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took for himself his wife, 25 And did not know her until she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name JESUS.</p>
