  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And after six days, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them upon a high mountain separately. 2 And he was transfigured before them. His face shone as the sun, and his clothing was white as the light. 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. 4 Then Peter answered, and said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 5 While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear him." 6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face and were in great fear. 7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, "<span class="woc">Arise, and do not be afraid.</span>" 8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, except Jesus only.</p>

  <p>9 And as they were descending the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "<span class="woc">Tell the vision to no man until the Son of man is raised again from the dead.</span>" 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 11 And Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Elijah truly will come first and restore all things.</span> 12 <span class="woc">But I say to you, that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him, but have done to him whatever they pleased. Likewise, the Son of man will also suffer by them.</span>" 13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.</p>

  <p>14 And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him, and saying, 15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and grievously distressed. He often falls into the fire and often into the water. 16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him." 17 Then Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.</span>" 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him. And the child was cured from that very hour.</p>

  <p>19 Then the disciples came to Jesus separately, and said, "Why could we not cast him out?" 20 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Because of your unbelief. For truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, 'Remove from here to yonder place,' and it shall remove. And nothing shall be impossible to you.</span> 21 <span class="woc">However, this kind does not go out, but by prayer and fasting.</span>"</p>

  <p>22 And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> 23 <span class="woc">And they will kill him. And on the third day he will be raised again.</span>" And they were exceedingly grieved.</p>

  <p>24 And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received tribute-money came to Peter, and said, "Does your Master not pay tribute?" 25 He says, "Yes." And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "<span class="woc">What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? From their own children, or from strangers?</span>" 26 Peter says to him, "From strangers." Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">Then the children are free.</span> 27 <span class="woc">However, lest we should offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the fish that first comes up. And when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money. Take that, and give it to them for me and you.</span>"</p>
