  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, 2 "<span class="woc">You know that after two days is the passover and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span>"</p>

  <p>3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill him. 5 But they said, "Not on the feast-day, lest there be an uproar among the people."</p>

  <p>6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 7 A woman having an alabaster-box of very precious ointment came to him and poured it on his head as he sat at the table. 8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, "To what purpose is this waste? 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor." 10 When Jesus understood it, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Why do you trouble the woman? For she has wrought a good work upon me.</span> 11 <span class="woc">For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.</span> 12 <span class="woc">For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</span> 13 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, this, which this woman has done, shall also be told there for a memorial of her.</span>"</p>

  <p>14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, 15 And said, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" And they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. 16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>

  <p>17 Now on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you wish that we prepare for you to eat the passover?" 18 And he said, "<span class="woc">Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, 'The Master says, "My time is at hand. I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples."'</span>" 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover.</p>

  <p>20 Now when the evening had come, he sat down with the twelve. 21 And as they were eating, he said, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</span>" 22 And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to him, "Lord, is it I?" 23 And he answered and said, "<span class="woc">He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.</span> 24 <span class="woc">The Son of man goes, as it is written concerning him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.</span>" 25 Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, "Master, is it I?" He said to him, "<span class="woc">You have said.</span>"</p>

  <p>26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, "<span class="woc">Take, eat. This is my body.</span>" 27 And he took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "<span class="woc">Drink from it, all of you.</span> 28 <span class="woc">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> 29 <span class="woc">But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span>"</p>

  <p>30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 31 Then Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">All of you shall be offended because of me this night, for it is written, '<cite>I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</cite>'</span> 32 <span class="woc">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span>" 33 Peter answered and said to him, "Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet I will never be offended." 34 Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, that this night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.</span>" 35 Peter said to him, "Though I should die with you, yet I will not deny you." All the disciples also said likewise.</p>

  <p>36 Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane and says to the disciples, "<span class="woc">Sit here while I go yonder and pray.</span>" 37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 38 Then he says to them, "<span class="woc">My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me.</span>"</p>

  <p>39 And he went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, "<span class="woc">O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.</span>" 40 And he comes to the disciples and finds them asleep, and says to Peter, "<span class="woc">What, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> 41 <span class="woc">Watch and pray so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span>"</p>

  <p>42 He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, "<span class="woc">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me unless I drink it, may your will be done.</span>" 43 And he came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy. 44 And he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 45 Then he comes to his disciples and says to them, "<span class="woc">Sleep on now and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> 46 <span class="woc">Rise, let us be going. Behold, he is at hand who betrays me.</span>"</p>

  <p>47 And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs from the chief priests and elders of the people. 48 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him." 49 And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail Master," and kissed him. 50 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Friend, why have you come?</span>" Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</p>

  <p>51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest and smote off his ear. 52 Then Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Put your sword back into its place. For all those who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</span> 53 <span class="woc">Do you think that I cannot now pray to my Father and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> 54 <span class="woc">But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled which say it must be so?</span>"</p>

  <p>55 In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "<span class="woc">Have you come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and you laid no hold upon me.</span> 56 <span class="woc">But all this was done so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span>" Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</p>

  <p>57 And those who had laid hold upon Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 58 But Peter followed him at a distance to the high priest's palace, went in, and sat with the servants to see the end.</p>

  <p>59 Now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put him to death, 60 But found none. And though many false witnesses came, yet they found none. At the last, two false witnesses came, 61 And said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.'" 62 And the high priest arose and said to him, "Do you answer nothing? What is it which these testify against you?" 63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said to him, "I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God." 64 Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">You have said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and '<cite>coming in the clouds of heaven.</cite>'</span>"</p>

  <p>65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, "He has spoken blasphemy. What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. 66 What do you think?" They answered and said, "He is guilty of death."</p>

  <p>67 Then they spit in his face and buffeted him. And others smote him with the palms of their hands, 68 Saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is he who smote you?"</p>

  <p>69 Now Peter sat outside in the palace. And a woman-servant came to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee." 70 But he denied before them all, saying, "I do not know what you say." 71 And when he had gone out into the porch, another woman-servant saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth." 72 And again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the man." 73 And after a while those who stood by came to him and said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech betrays you." 74 Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, "I do not know the man." And immediately the cock crowed. 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.</p>

  <p>[v.56] - "the Scriptures of the prophets" - Jesus is likely referring to Psalm 41:9 and/or Zechariah 13:7. From John Gill's Exposition: "But all this was done, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled,... Some have thought these to be the words of the evangelist, making this remark upon what was said and done; but by what both Mark and Luke record, Mark 14:49, they appear to be the words of Christ himself; who observes this, partly to make himself, as man, easy under the treatment he met with; and partly, to fortify the minds of his disciples against offence at it; and also to throw conviction, or confusion, into the minds of his enemies. The Scriptures of the prophets he refers to, as having, or about to have, by this conduct, their accomplishment, were such, as regarded the betraying him by Judas, the taking him in this secret, private, insidious, yet violent manner; in all which he showed great meekness, calmness, and submission, as Psalm 41:9. As also what respected the scattering, and hasty flight of his disciples from him, Zechariah 13:7, which in the next clause is shown to be accomplished..."</p>
