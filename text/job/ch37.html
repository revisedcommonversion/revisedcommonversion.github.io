  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "At this also my heart trembles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and is moved out of its place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Hear attentively the noise of his voice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the sound that goes out of his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He directs it under the whole heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his lightning to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> After it a voice roars.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He thunders with the voice of his excellence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> God thunders marvelously with his voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does great things which we cannot comprehend.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For he says to the snow, 'Be on the earth,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He seals up the hand of every man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that all men may know his work.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Then the beasts go into dens<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and remain in their places.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> From the south comes the whirlwind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cold from the north.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> By the breath of God frost is given,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the breadth of the waters is constrained.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Also by watering he wearies the thick cloud.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He scatters his bright cloud,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And it is turned around by his counsels<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they may do whatever he commands them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the face of the world on the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He causes it to come, whether for correction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his land, or for mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Listen to this, O Job.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Do you know when God disposed them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Do you know the balancings of the clouds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> You whose garments are warm,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he quiets the earth by the south wind?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Have you with him spread out the sky<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which is strong and as a cast metal mirror?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Teach us what we shall say to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Shall it be told to him that I speak?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If a man speaks, surely he will be swallowed up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And now men do not see the bright light which is in the clouds.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the wind passes and cleanses them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Fair weather comes from the north.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With God is awesome majesty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is excellent in power,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in judgment, and in abundance of justice. He will not afflict.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Men therefore fear him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not respect any who are wise of heart."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2037.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 37</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Elihu in this chapter proceeds to show the greatness of God as it appears in some other of his works of nature, which greatly affected him, and to an attention to which he exhorts others (verses 1-2); particularly thunder and lightning, the direction, extent, and order of which he observes (verses 3-4); and then suggests that besides these there are other great things done by him, incomprehensible and unknown in various respects; as the snow, and rain, lesser and greater, which come on the earth at his command, and have such effect on men as to seal up their hands, and on the beasts of the field as to cause them to retire to their dens, and there remain (verses 5-8); and then he goes on to take notice of wind, and frost, and the clouds, and dispersion of them; their use and ends, whether in judgment or mercy (verses 9-13); and then calls on Job to consider these wondrous works of God, and remark how ignorant men are of the disposition of clouds for the rainbow; of the balancing of them; of the heat and quietness that come by the south wind, and of the firmness of the sky (verses 14-21); and from all this he concludes the terrible majesty, unsearchable nature of God, the excellency of his power and justice; and that men therefore should and do fear him, who is no respecter of persons (verses 21-23).</p>
