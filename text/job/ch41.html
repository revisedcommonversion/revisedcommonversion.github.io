    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Will he make many supplications to you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will he speak soft words to you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Will he make a covenant with you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you take him for a servant forever?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Behold, the hope of him is in vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall one not be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> No one is so fierce that he dare rouse him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who then is able to stand before me?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Who has first benefited me that I should repay him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I will not conceal his parts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor his power, nor his orderly proportion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Who can discover the face of his garment?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who can come to him with his double bridle?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Who can open the doors of his face?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His teeth are terrible around.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> His scales are his pride,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shut together as with a compact seal.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> One is so near to another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that no air can come between them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They are joined to one another.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They stick together so that they cannot be separated.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> His sneezings flash light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Out of his mouth go burning lamps,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sparks of fire dart forth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Out of his nostrils issues smoke<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as from a boiling pot or cauldron.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> His breath kindles coals,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a flame issues from his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> In his neck remains strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The hanging parts of his flesh are joined together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are firm in themselves. They cannot be moved.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> His heart is as firm as a stone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> When he raises himself, the mighty are afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />By reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> The sword of him who attacks him cannot hold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the spear, the dart, or the habergeon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He esteems iron as straw<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brass as rotten wood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> The arrow cannot make him flee.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Darts are counted as stubble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He laughs at the shaking of a spear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Sharp stones are under him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He spreads sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> He makes the deep to boil like a pot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> He makes a path to shine after him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />One would think the deep to be hoary.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Upon earth there is nothing like him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who is made without fear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> He beholds all high things.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is a king over all the children of pride."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2041.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 41</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>A large description is here given of the leviathan, from the difficulty and danger of taking it, from where it is inferred that none can stand before God (verses 1-10); from the several parts of him, his face, teeth, scales, eyes, mouth and neck, flesh and heart (verses 11-24); and from various wonderful and terrible things said of him, and ascribed to him (verses 25-34).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "leviathan" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">לויתן</span> (liv-yaw-thawn'). LXX: "the serpent." It is not certain to which creature the word leviathan refers. It is believed to be either a giant sea creature, such as a whale or an orca, or it could be the crocodile. John Gill posits that the text from the end of chapter 40 and the text here in this chapter makes sense if behemoth is a hippopotamus and leviathan is a crocodile because both existed on the Nile River, and therefore better known to Job than the whale or the orca. But he then states that some parts of leviathan's description fit the crocodile, some the whale or the orca, and some fit neither. Robert Hawker makes a very good point on this disagreement: "I stay not to offer any comment upon this description of the Leviathan, neither shall I enter into an inquiry what animal it is that is here intended by the Leviathan. Some have thought that it is the crocodile that is meant to be described, and others conceive that it is the whale. But it appears to me to be of little importance to inquire. It is sufficient that it is a creature of God, and, as such, displays in its formation God's power and sovereignty. And the conclusion to be made from the view of such a wonderful production, is best made in the words of God himself (verse 10): 'If a man would tremble at the idea of stirring up such a creature, who can be able to stand before God? If the thing created be tremendous, what must the great Creator be?'"</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoted in Romans 11:35. Reference, Job 22:2-3, 35:7.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "compact" - Latin: conpactus. WBS/KJV: "shut together as with a close seal."</p>
  <p>[v.23] - "hanging parts" - That is, dewlaps. A dewlap is the flesh that hangs from the throat of oxen, which laps or licks the dew in grazing.</p>
