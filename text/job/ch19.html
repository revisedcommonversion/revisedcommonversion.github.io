  <p>1 Then Job answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "How long will you vex my soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and break me in pieces with words?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> These ten times you have reproached me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And if it is indeed that I have erred,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my error remains with myself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and plead against me my reproach,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Know now that God has overthrown me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has encompassed me with his net.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He has fenced up my way so that I cannot pass<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he has set darkness in my paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He has stripped me of my glory<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and taken the crown from my head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And my hope he has removed like a tree.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> He has also kindled his wrath against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he counts me to him as one of his enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> His troops come together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />raise up their way against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and encamp around my tabernacle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He has put my brothers far from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my acquaintances are truly estranged from me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> My kinsmen have failed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Those who dwell in my house and my women-servants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />count me for a stranger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am a foreigner in their sight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I entreated him with my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> My breath is strange to my wife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I entreated to the children of my mother's womb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Young children even despise me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I arose, and they spoke against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> All my intimate friends abhorred me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And those whom I loved have turned against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> My bone cleaves to my skin and to my flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the hand of God has touched me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Why do you persecute me as God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Oh that my words were now written!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Oh that they were printed in a book!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Oh that they were engraved with an iron pen and lead<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the rock forever!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> For I know that my redeemer lives<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> And after my skin is destroyed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet in my flesh I shall see God,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Whom I shall see for myself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my eyes shall behold, and not another.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart is consumed within me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Therefore, you should say, 'Why do we persecute him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />seeing the root of the matter is found in him?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Be afraid of the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for wrath brings the punishments of the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may know there is a judgment."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2019.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 19</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains Job's reply to Bildad's second speech, in which he complains of the ill usage of his friends, of their continuing to vex him, and to beat, and bruise, and break him in pieces with their hard words, and to reproach him, and carry it strange to him (verses 1-3); which he thought was very cruel, since, if he was mistaken, the mistake lay with himself (verse 4); and if they were determined to go on at this rate, he would have them observe, that his afflictions were of God, and therefore should take care to what they imputed them, since he could not get the reasons of them, or his cause to be heard, though he vehemently and importunately sought it (verses 5-7); and then gives an enumeration of the several particulars of his distress, all which he ascribes to God (verses 8-12); and he enlarges upon that part of his unhappy case, respecting the alienation of his nearest relations, most intimate acquaintance and friends, from him, and their contempt of him, and the like treatment he met with from his servants, and even young children (verses 13-19); all which, with other troubles, had such an effect upon him as to reduce him to a mere skeleton, and which he mentions to move the pity of these his friends, now conversing with him (verses 20-22); and yet after all, and in the midst of it, and which was his great support under his trials, he expresses his strong faith in his living Redeemer, who should appear on the earth in the latter day, and be his Savior, and in the resurrection of the dead through him, which he believed he should share in, and in all the happiness consequent on it; and he wishes this confession of his faith might be written and engraved, and be preserved on a rock forever for the good of posterity (verses 23-27); and closes the chapter with an expostulation with his friends, dissuading them from persecuting him any longer, since there was no reason for it in himself, and it might be attended with bad consequences to them (verses 28-29).</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "I cry aloud, but there is no judgment" - Or, "I cry for help, but there is no justice."</p>
  <p>[v.17] - "of my mother's womb" - From the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary: "The 'my' forbids it being taken of his wife. Besides their children were dead. In Job 3:10 the same words 'my womb' mean, my mother's womb: therefore translate, 'and I must entreat (as a suppliant) the children of my mother's womb;' that is, my own brothers—a heightening of force, as compared with last clause of Job 19:16. Not only must I entreat suppliantly my servant, but my own brothers (Psalm 69:8). Here too, he unconsciously foreshadows Jesus Christ (John 7:5)."</p>
  <p>[v.26] - From the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge: "After I shall awake, though this body is destroyed, yet out of my flesh I shall see God."</p>
