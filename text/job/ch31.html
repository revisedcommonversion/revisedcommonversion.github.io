  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "I made a covenant with my eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why then should I think upon a virgin?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For what portion of God is there from above,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Is destruction not for the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a strange punishment for the workers of iniquity?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Does he not see my ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and count all my steps?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> If I have walked with vanity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or if my foot has hastened to deceit,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Let me be weighed in an even balance<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that God may know my integrity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> If my step has turned out of the way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my heart walked after my eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and if any blot has cleaved to my hands,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Then let me sow and let another eat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even let my offspring be rooted out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> If my heart has been deceived by a woman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or if I have laid wait at my neighbor's door,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Then let my wife grind to another<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let others bow down upon her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For this is a heinous crime.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For it is a fire that consumes to destruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and would root out all my increase.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> If I despised the cause of my man-servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or of my woman-servant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when they contended with me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> What then shall I do when God rises up?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And when he visits, what shall I answer him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Did he who made me in the womb not make him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And did one not fashion us in the womb?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> If I have withheld the poor from their desire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Or have eaten my morsel myself alone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fatherless has not eaten of it</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have guided her from my mother's womb),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> If I have seen any perish for lack of clothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or any poor without covering,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> If his loins have not blessed me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and if he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I saw my help in the gate,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Then let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my arm be broken from the bone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> For destruction from God was a terror to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> If I have made gold my hope,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or have said to the fine gold, 'You are my confidence,'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and because my hand had gained much,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> If I have beheld the sun when it shined,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the moon walking in brightness,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> And my heart has been secretly enticed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or my mouth has kissed my hand,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> This also would have been an iniquity to be punished by the judge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I would have denied the God who is above.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or have lifted up myself when evil found him</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> (For I have not allowed my mouth to sin<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by wishing a curse to his soul),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> If the men of my tabernacle have not said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his flesh?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> (The stranger did not lodge in the street,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I opened my doors to the traveler),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> If I have covered my transgressions as Adam<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Because I feared a great multitude,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the contempt of families terrified me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> Oh that one would hear me!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that my adversary had written a book.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bind it as a crown to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> I would declare to him the number of my steps.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />As a prince I would go near to him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> If my land cries against me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or its furrows likewise complain,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> If I have eaten its fruits without money,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or have caused its owners to lose their life,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> Let thistles grow instead of wheat<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and weeds instead of barley."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Job gives an account of himself in private life, of the integrity and uprightness of his life, and his holy walk and conversation, with this view, that it might be thought that the afflictions which were upon him were not on account of a vicious course of life he had indulged to, as was suggested; and he clears himself from various crimes which it might be insinuated he was guilty of, as from unchastity; and he observes the method he took to prevent his falling into it, and the reasons that dissuaded him from it (verses 1-4); from injustice in his dealings with men (verses 5-8); from the sin of adultery (verses 9-12); from ill usage of his servants (verses 13-15); from unkindness to the poor, which he enlarges upon, and gives many instances of his charity to them (verses 16-23); from covetousness, and a vain confidence in wealth (verses 24-25); from idolatry, the worship of the sun and moon (verses 26-28); from a revengeful spirit (verses 29-31); and from inhospitality to strangers (verse 32); from covering his sin (verse 33); and fear of men (verse 34); and then wishes his cause might be heard before God (verses 35-37); and the chapter is closed with an imprecation on his head if guilty of any injustice (verses 38-40).</p>
  <p>[v.13] - "when they contended with me" - From the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge: "In ancient times slaves had no action at law against their owners; but Job admitted them to all civil rights, and permitted them to complain even against himself."</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "one" - That is, he, as in God.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - "her" - That is, the widow.</p>
  <p>[v.33] - "Adam" - Or, "after the manner of men."</p>
