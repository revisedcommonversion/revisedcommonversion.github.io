  <p>1 Elihu also proceeded and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Allow me a little, and I will show you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> I will bring my knowledge from afar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> For truly my words shall not be false.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Behold, God is mighty and does not despise anyone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He does not preserve the life of the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but gives right to the poor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But with kings on the throne,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he even establishes them forever, and they are exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And if they are bound in fetters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and are held in cords of affliction,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Then he shows them their work<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He also opens their ear to discipline<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and commands that they return from iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> If they obey and serve him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they shall spend their days in prosperity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their years in pleasures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and die without knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not cry when he binds them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> They die in youth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their life is among the unclean.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He delivers the poor in his affliction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and opens their ears in oppression.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Even so he would have enticed you out of distress<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />into a broad place where there is no constraint,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which should be set on your table would be full of fatness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Judgment and justice take hold of you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take you away with his stroke.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then a great ransom cannot deliver you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Will he esteem your riches? No, not gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor all the forces of strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Do not desire the night<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when people are cut off in their place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Take heed, do not regard iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for this you have chosen rather than affliction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Behold, God exalts by his power.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who teaches like him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Who has enjoined him his way?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who can say, 'You have wrought iniquity'?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Remember that you magnify his work,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which men behold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Every man may see it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Man may behold it afar off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Behold, God is great, and we do not know him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> For he makes the drops of water small.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They pour down rain according to its vapor,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Which the clouds drop<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and distill upon man abundantly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Behold, he spreads his light upon it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and covers the bottom of the sea.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> For by them he judges the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He gives food in abundance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> With clouds he covers the light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and commands it not to shine by the intervening cloud.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> The noise thereof announces him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the cattle also, concerning the storm that comes up."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter, with the following, contains Elihu's fourth and last discourse, the principal view of which is to vindicate the righteousness of God; which is done by observing the dealings of God with men in his providence, according to their different characters, and from the wonderful works wrought by him in a sovereign manner, and for the benefit of his creatures. This chapter is introduced with a preface, the design of which is to gain attention (verses 1-4); the different dealings of God with men are observed, and the different issue of them, and the different ends answered thereby (verses 5-15); and it is suggested to Job, that had he attended to the design of the providence he was under, and had submitted to it patiently, things would have been otherwise with him; and therefore Elihu proceeds to give him some advice, which, if taken, would be for his own good, and the glory of God (verses 16-25); and closes the chapter by observing the unsearchable greatness of God, as appears by the works of nature wrought by him (verses 26-33).</p>
