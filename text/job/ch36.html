  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Elihu also proceeded and said,</p>

  <p>2 "Allow me a little, and I will show you that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</p>

  <p>3 I will bring my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>

  <p>4 For truly my words shall not be false. He who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>

  <p>5 Behold, God is mighty and does not despise anyone. He is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>

  <p>6 He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives right to the poor.</p>

  <p>7 He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous. But with kings on the throne, he even establishes them forever, and they are exalted.</p>

  <p>8 And if they are bound in fetters and are held in cords of affliction,</p>

  <p>9 Then he shows them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>

  <p>10 He also opens their ear to discipline and commands that they return from iniquity.</p>

  <p>11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures.</p>

  <p>12 But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</p>

  <p>13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath. They do not cry when he binds them.</p>

  <p>14 They die in youth and their life is among the unclean.</p>

  <p>15 He delivers the poor in his affliction and opens their ears in oppression.</p>

  <p>16 Even so he would have enticed you out of distress into a broad place where there is no constraint, and that which should be set on your table would be full of fatness.</p>

  <p>17 But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you.</p>

  <p>18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take you away with his stroke. Then a great ransom cannot deliver you.</p>

  <p>19 Will he esteem your riches? No, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>

  <p>20 Do not desire the night when people are cut off in their place.</p>

  <p>21 Take heed, do not regard iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction.</p>

  <p>22 Behold, God exalts by his power. Who teaches like him?</p>

  <p>23 Who has enjoined him his way? Or who can say, 'You have wrought iniquity'?</p>

  <p>24 Remember that you magnify his work, which men behold.</p>

  <p>25 Every man may see it. Man may behold it afar off.</p>

  <p>26 Behold, God is great, and we do not know him, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>

  <p>27 For he makes the drops of water small. They pour down rain according to its vapor,</p>

  <p>28 Which the clouds drop and distill upon man abundantly.</p>

  <p>29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>

  <p>30 Behold, he spreads his light upon it and covers the bottom of the sea.</p>

  <p>31 For by them he judges the people. He gives food in abundance.</p>

  <p>32 With clouds he covers the light and commands it not to shine by the intervening cloud.</p>

  <p>33 The noise thereof announces him, the cattle also, concerning the storm that comes up."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2036.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 36</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter, with the following, contains Elihu's fourth and last discourse, the principal view of which is to vindicate the righteousness of God; which is done by observing the dealings of God with men in his providence, according to their different characters, and from the wonderful works wrought by him in a sovereign manner, and for the benefit of his creatures. This chapter is introduced with a preface, the design of which is to gain attention (verses 1-4); the different dealings of God with men are observed, and the different issue of them, and the different ends answered thereby (verses 5-15); and it is suggested to Job, that had he attended to the design of the providence he was under, and had submitted to it patiently, things would have been otherwise with him; and therefore Elihu proceeds to give him some advice, which, if taken, would be for his own good, and the glory of God (verses 16-25); and closes the chapter by observing the unsearchable greatness of God, as appears by the works of nature wrought by him (verses 26-33).</p>
