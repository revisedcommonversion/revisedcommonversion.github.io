  <p>1 Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Oh that I were as in months past,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as in the days when God preserved me,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> When his candle shined upon my head<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by his light I walked through darkness,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> As I was in the days of my youth;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> When the Almighty was yet with me;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when my children were around me;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> When I washed my steps with butter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> When I went out to the gate through the city;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when I prepared my seat in the street!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The young men saw me and hid themselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the aged arose and stood up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The princes refrained from talking<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and laid their hand on their mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The nobles held their peace<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> When the ear heard me, it blessed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For I delivered the poor who cried,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fatherless, and him who had no one to help him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The blessing of him who was ready to perish came upon me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> I was eyes to the blind<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was feet to the lame.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> I was a father to the poor.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the cause which I did not know, I searched out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And I broke the jaws of the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Then I said, 'I shall die in my nest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and multiply my days as the sand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> My root was spread out by the waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> My glory was fresh in me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my bow was renewed in my hand.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> To me men gave ear, waited,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and kept silence at my counsel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> After my words they did not speak again,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my speech dropped upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And they waited for me as for the rain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> If I laughed at them, they did not believe it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> I chose out their way, sat as chief,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and dwelt as a king in the army,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as one who comforts the mourners."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Job gives an account of his former and wishes it was with him now as then; and which he describes with respect to his own person, and the favors he personally enjoyed, whether temporal or spiritual (verses 1-4); with respect to his family and domestic affairs (verses 5-6); with regard to the esteem he had from men of every age and station (verses 7-11); the reasons of which were the mercy and compassion he showed to the poor, the fatherless, and the widow, and the justice he administered in the execution of his office as a magistrate (verses 12-17); in which honor and prosperity he expected to have lived and died (verses 18-20); and which he further describes by the respect he had among men, and the power and authority he exercised over them (verses 21-25).</p>
  <p>[v.23] - LXX: "As the thirsty earth expecting the rain, so they [waited for] my speech."</p>
