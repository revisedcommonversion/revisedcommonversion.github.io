  <p>1 Then Job answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Even today my complaint is bitter.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Oh that I might come even to his seat!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I would order my cause before him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I would know the words which he would answer me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and understand what he would say to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Would he plead against me with his great power?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />No, but he would put strength in me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> There the righteous might dispute with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I would be delivered forever from my judge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I go backward, but I cannot perceive him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> I go on the left hand where he works,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but I cannot behold him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He hides himself on the right hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I cannot see him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But he knows the way that I take.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> My foot has held his steps.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His way I have kept and not declined,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my appointed food.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what his soul desires, even that he does.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> For he performs the thing that is appointed for me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And many such things are with him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Therefore, I am troubled at his presence.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For God makes my heart soft,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Almighty troubles me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For I am not cut off by the darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he has hidden the darkness from my face."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2023.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 23</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This and the following chapter contain Job's reply to the last oration of Eliphaz; in this he first declares his present sorrowful estate and condition (verses 1-2); wishes he knew where to find God, as a judge sitting on a throne, before whom he might lay his cause, and plead it, and have his judgment and final decision passed upon it; when he doubted not but he would deal favorably with him, and both admit him and strengthen him, to plead his own cause, and would acquit him forever from the charges laid against him (verses 3-7); in order to which he sought for him everywhere, but could not find him, but contents himself with this, that God knew his way; and that, after trial of him, he should shine like pure gold, and appear to be no apostate from him, but one sincerely obedient to his commands, and a true lover of his word (verses 8-12); and as for his afflictions, they were the result of the unalterable purposes and appointments of God: but what gave him the greatest uneasiness was, that there were more of that sort yet to come, which filled him with fears and faintings, with trouble and darkness (verses 13-17).</p>
  <p>[v.3-7] - Here Job desires an audience with God to speak to him. God later addresses Job in chapters 38-41.</p>
