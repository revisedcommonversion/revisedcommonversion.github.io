    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Behold, my eye has seen all this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my ear has heard and understood it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> What you know, the same I also know.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am not inferior to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Surely I would speak to the Almighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I desire to reason with God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> But you are forgers of lies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You are all physicians of no value.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O that you would altogether hold your peace<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it would be your wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Hear now my reasoning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and listen to the pleadings of my lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Will you speak wickedly for God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and talk deceitfully for him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Will you accept his person?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you contend for God?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Is it good that he should search you out?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or as one man mocks another, do you likewise mock him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He will surely reprove you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if you secretly accept persons.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Shall his excellence not make you afraid<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his dread fall upon you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Your remembrances are like ashes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your defenses like defenses of clay.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Hold your peace. Leave me alone so that I may speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let come on me what will.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Why do I take my flesh in my teeth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and put my life in my hand?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But I will maintain my own ways before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He also shall be my salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a hypocrite shall not come before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Hear diligently my speech<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my declaration with your ears.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Behold now, I have ordered my cause.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I know that I shall be justified.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Who is he who will plead with me?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Only do not do two things to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then I will not hide myself from you:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Withdraw your hand far from me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let your dread make me afraid.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Then call, and I will answer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or let me speak, and answer me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> How many are my iniquities and sins?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Why do you hide your face<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hold me for your enemy?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Will you terrify a leaf driven to and fro?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And will you pursue the dry stubble?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> For you write bitter things against me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> You put my feet also in the stocks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and look narrowly to all my paths.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You set a print upon the soles of my feet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And he, as a rotten thing, consumes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a garment that is moth-eaten."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2013.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 13</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Job begins this chapter by observing the extensiveness of his knowledge, as appeared from his preceding discourse, by which it was evident he was not less knowing than his friends (verses 1-2); and therefore would have nothing to do with them as judges in his cause, but would appeal to God, and debate the matter before him, and leave it to his decision, since he could expect no good from them (verse 3-4); and all the favor he entreats of them is, that they would for the future be no longer speakers, but hearers (verses 5-6, 13, 17); he expostulates with them about their wicked and deceitful way of pleading for God, and against him (verses 7-8); and in order to strike an awe upon them, suggests to them, that they were liable to the divine scrutiny; that God was not to be mocked by them, that he would surely reprove them for their respect of persons, and desires them to consider his dreadful majesty, and what frail creatures they were (verses 9-12); then he expresses his confidence in God, that he should be saved by him, notwithstanding the afflictive circumstances he was in (verses 14-16); and doubted not he should be able so to plead his cause, as that he should be justified, if God would but withdraw his hand, and take off his dread from him (verses 18-22); he desires to know what his sins were, that he should hide his face from him, and treat him with so much severity, who was but a poor, weak, feeble creature (verses 24-25); and concludes with a complaint of the bitterness and sharpness of his afflictions, with which he was consumed (verses 26-28).</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "defenses" - That is, defenses used in arguments.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him." - This can also be read as, "Behold, he will slay me. I have no hope."</p>
  <p>[v.16] - Quoted in Philippians 1:19.</p>
  <p>[v.20] - "from you" - Or, "from your face."</p>
  <p>[v.25] - "terrify" - Literally, "cause to tremble."</p>
  <p>[v.27a] - "look narrowly to" - That is, mark, watch (suspiciously).</p>
  <p>[v.27b] - "soles" - Literally, "roots," that is, the bottom (root) of the feet.</p>
