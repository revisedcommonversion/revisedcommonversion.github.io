    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Why, seeing times are not hid from the Almighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do those who know him not see his days?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Some remove the landmarks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They violently take away flocks and their feed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They turn the needy out of the way.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they go forth to their work, seeking for a prey.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The wilderness yields food for them and for their children.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> They each reap his grain in the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they have no covering in the cold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They are wet with the showers of the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They pluck the fatherless from the breast<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take a pledge of the poor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They cause him to go naked without clothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they take away the sheaf from the hungry,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Who make oil within their walls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Men groan from out of the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the soul of the wounded cries out.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet God does not lay folly to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They are of those who rebel against the light.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not know its ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor abide in its paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The murderer rising with the light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />kills the poor and needy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the night is as a thief.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Also the eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />saying, 'No eye shall see me,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and disguises his face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> In the dark they dig through houses<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which they had marked for themselves in the day-time.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not know the light.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He is swift as the waters.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their portion is cursed in the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not behold the way of the vineyards.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> As drought and heat consume the snow-waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so does the grave to those who have sinned.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The womb shall forget him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The worm shall feed sweetly on him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall no longer be remembered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He oppresses the barren who does not bear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not do good to the widow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> He also draws the mighty with his power.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He rises up, and no man is sure of life.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Though it is given him to be in safety, on which he rests,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They are exalted for a little while,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but are gone and brought low. They are taken out of the way as all others,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cut off as the tops of the heads of grain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> And if it is not so now, who will make me a liar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make my speech of no worth?"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2024.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 24</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the second part of Job's answer to the last discourse of Eliphaz, in which he shows that wicked men, those of the worst characters, prosper in the world, and go through it with impunity; he lays down this as a certain truth, that though no time is hid from God, yet those who are most familiar with him, and know most of him, do not see, and cannot observe, any days of his for judging and punishing wicked men in this life (verse 1); and instances in men guilty of injustice, violence, oppression, cruelty, and inhumanity, to their neighbors, and yet God does not lay folly to them, or charges them with sin, and punishes them for it (verses 2-12); and in persons that commit the most atrocious crimes in secret, such as murderers, adulterers, and thieves (verses 13-17); he allows that there is a curse upon their portion, and that the grave shall consume them, and they shall be remembered no more (verses 18-20); and because of their ill treatment of others, though they may be in safety and prosperity, and be exalted for a while, they shall be brought low and cut off by death, but generally speaking are not punished in this life (verses 21-24); and concludes with the greatest assurance of being in the right, and having truth on his side (verse 25).</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "disguises his face" - Literally, "sets his face in secret." In other words, "puts a covering on his face." The covering could be the hood of a cloak.</p>
  <p>[v.19] - "consume" - Literally, "violently take."</p>
  <p>[v.22] - "no man is sure of life" - In other words, "he does not trust his own life."</p>
