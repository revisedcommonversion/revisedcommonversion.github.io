  <p>1 Elihu spoke moreover and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Do you think this to be right that you said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'My righteousness is more than God's'?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For you said, 'What advantage will it be to you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What profit shall I have if I am cleansed from my sin?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> I will answer you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your companions with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Look to the heavens and see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold the clouds which are higher than you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> If you sin, what do you do against him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or if your transgressions are multiplied,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />what do you do to him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> If you are righteous, what do you give to him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or what does he receive from your hand?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your righteousness may profit the son of man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they make the oppressed to cry.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> But no one says, 'Where is God my maker<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who gives songs in the night,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> There they cry, but no one gives answer<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the pride of evil men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Surely God will not hear vanity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Although you say you shall not see him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet judgment is before him; therefore, trust in him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet he does not know it in great extremity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Therefore, Job opens his mouth in vain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He multiplies words without knowledge."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Is this chapter Elihu goes on to charge Job with other unbecoming speeches, which he undertakes to refute; as that he had represented his cause more just than God's, and religion and righteousness as things unprofitable to men, only to God; to which Elihu takes upon him to make answer (verses 1-8); and that the cries of the oppressed were not heard by the Lord, so as to give occasion to songs of praise and thankfulness, to which he replies (verses 9-13); and that Job had expressed diffidence and despair of ever seeing and enjoying the favor of God, which he endeavors to remove (verses 14-16).</p>
