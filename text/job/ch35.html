  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Elihu spoke moreover and said,</p>

  <p>2 "Do you think this to be right that you said, 'My righteousness is more than God's'?</p>

  <p>3 For you said, 'What advantage will it be to you? What profit shall I have if I am cleansed from my sin?'</p>

  <p>4 I will answer you and your companions with you.</p>

  <p>5 Look to the heavens and see, and behold the clouds which are higher than you.</p>

  <p>6 If you sin, what do you do against him? Or if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</p>

  <p>7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand?</p>

  <p>8 Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit the son of man.</p>

  <p>9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry. They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>

  <p>10 But no one says, 'Where is God my maker who gives songs in the night,</p>

  <p>11 Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?'</p>

  <p>12 There they cry, but no one gives answer because of the pride of evil men.</p>

  <p>13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>

  <p>14 Although you say you shall not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore, trust in him.</p>

  <p>15 But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger, yet he does not know it in great extremity.</p>

  <p>16 Therefore, Job opens his mouth in vain. He multiplies words without knowledge."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Is this chapter Elihu goes on to charge Job with other unbecoming speeches, which he undertakes to refute; as that he had represented his cause more just than God's, and religion and righteousness as things unprofitable to men, only to God; to which Elihu takes upon him to make answer (verses 1-8); and that the cries of the oppressed were not heard by the Lord, so as to give occasion to songs of praise and thankfulness, to which he replies (verses 9-13); and that Job had expressed diffidence and despair of ever seeing and enjoying the favor of God, which he endeavors to remove (verses 14-16).</p>
