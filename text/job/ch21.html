  <p>1 But Job answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Hear diligently my speech,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let this be your consolations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Allow me that I may speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And after I have spoken, mock on.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> As for me, is my complaint to man?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And if it were so, why should my spirit not be troubled?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Mark me, be astonished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Even when I remember I am afraid,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and trembling takes hold of my flesh.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Why do the wicked live,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />become old, and are mighty in power?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Their posterity is established in their sight with them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their offspring before their eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Their houses are safe from fear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Their bull engenders and does not fail.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their cow brings forth and does not miscarry her calf.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> They send forth their little ones like a flock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their children dance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> They take the tambourine and harp<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They spend their days in wealth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore, they say to God, 'Depart from us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for we do not desire the knowledge of your ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> What is the Almighty that we should serve him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what profit should we have if we pray to him?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Behold, their good is not in their hand.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> How often is the candle of the wicked put out?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And how often does their destruction come upon them?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />God distributes sorrows in his anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> They are as stubble before the wind<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as chaff that the storm carries away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> God lays up his iniquity for his children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He rewards him, and he shall know it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> His own eyes shall see his destruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> For what pleasure does he have in his house after him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Shall any teach God knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />seeing that he judges those who are high?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> One dies in his full strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> His pails are full of milk<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> And another dies in the bitterness of his soul<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and never eats with pleasure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> They shall lie down alike in the dust,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the worms shall cover them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Behold, I know your thoughts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the devices which you wrongfully plot against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where are the dwelling places of the wicked?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Have you not asked those who go by the way?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And do you not know their tokens,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> That the wicked is reserved for the day of destruction?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They will be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who shall repay him what he has done?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Yet he shall be brought to the grave<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall remain in the tomb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> The clods of the valley will be sweet to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and every man will draw after him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as there are innumerable before him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> How then do you comfort me in vain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />seeing in your answers there remains falsehood?"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2021.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 21</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains Job's reply to Zophar's preceding discourse, in which, after a preface exciting attention to what he was about to say (verses 1-6); he describes by various instances the prosperity of wicked men, even of the most impious and atheistical, and which continues with them as long as they live, contrary to what Zophar had asserted in (verse 5, 7-15); as for himself, he disapproved of such wicked men as much as any, and owns that destruction comes upon them sooner or later, and on their posterity also (verses 16-21); but as God is a God of knowledge, and needs no instruction from any, and is a sovereign Being, he deals with men in different ways; some die in great ease, and peace, and prosperity, and others in bitterness and distress, but both are alike brought to the dust (verse 22-26); and whereas he was aware of their censures of him, and their objections to what he had said, he allows that the wicked are reserved to the day of destruction, which is future, and in the mean while lie in the grave, where all must follow; yet they are not repaid or rewarded in this life, that remains to be done in another world (verses 27-33); and concludes, that their consolation with respect to him was vain, and falsehood was in their answers (verse 34).</p>
