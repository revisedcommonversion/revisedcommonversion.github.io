    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He sets an end to darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to all perfection he searches out<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the stones of darkness and the shadow of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The flood breaks out from the inhabitant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the waters forgotten by the foot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are dried up. They have gone away from men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> As for the earth, out of it comes bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and underneath it is turned up as by fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Its stones are the place of sapphires,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it has dust of gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> There is a path which no bird knows,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and which the falcon's eye has not seen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He puts forth his hand upon the rock.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He overturns the mountains by the roots.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> He cuts out rivers among the rocks.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His eye sees every precious thing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> He binds the floods from overflowing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The thing that is hid he brings forth to light.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> But where shall wisdom be found?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where is the place of understanding?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Man does not know its price,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The depth says, 'It is not in me.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> It cannot be obtained for gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall silver be weighed for its price.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The gold and the crystal cannot equal it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its exchange shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The topaz of Cush shall not equal it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Where then does wisdom come from?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where is the place of understanding?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> It is hid from the eyes of all living<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and kept close from the birds of the air.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Destruction and death say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'We have heard its fame with our ears.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> When he made the weight for the winds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and weighed the waters by measure,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> When he made a decree for the rain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a way for the lightning of the thunder,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He saw it and declared it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He prepared it and even searched it out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And to man he said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And to depart from evil is understanding.'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The design of this chapter is either to show the folly of such who are very diligent in their search and pursuit after earthly things, and neglect an inquiry after that which is infinitely more valuable, true wisdom; or rather to observe, that though things the most secret, and which are hidden in the bowels of the earth, may be investigated and discovered by the sagacity and diligence of men, yet wisdom cannot, especially the wisdom of God in his providences, which are past finding out; and particularly in what concerns the prosperity of the wicked, and the afflictions of the righteous; the reason of which men should be content to be ignorant of for the present, and be studious to possess that wisdom which is attainable, and be thankful for it, if they have it; which lies in the fear of the Lord, and a departure from evil, with which this chapter concludes. It begins with setting forth the sagacity of men in searching and finding out useful metals, and other things the earth produces; the difficulty, fatigue, and labor, that attend such a search, and the dangers they are exposed to in it (verses 1-11); then it declares the unsearchableness of wisdom, its superior excellency to things the most valuable, and that it is not to be found by sea or land, or among any of the creatures (verses 12-22); and that God only knows its way and place, who has sought it out, prepared and declared it (verses 23-27); and that which he has thought fit to make known of it, and is most for his glory and the good of men, is, that it is to fear God, and depart from evil (verse 28).</p>
