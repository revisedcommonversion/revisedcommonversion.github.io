  <p>1 Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "As God lives, who has taken away my judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Almighty who has afflicted my soul,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> All the while my breath is in me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> My lips shall not speak wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Far be it from me that I should justify you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Until I die I will not remove my integrity from me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> My righteousness I hold firmly and will not let it go.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Let my enemy be as the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who rises up against me as the unrighteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when God takes away his soul?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Will God hear his cry<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when trouble comes upon him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will he always call upon God?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I will teach you by the hand of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />That which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why then are you thus altogether vain?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man with God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heritage of oppressors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which they shall receive from the Almighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Those who survive him shall be buried in death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his widows shall not weep.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Though he should heap up silver as the dust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and prepare clothing as the clay,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He builds his house as a moth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a booth that the watchman makes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He opens his eyes and he is no more.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Terrors take hold of him as waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a tempest steals him away in the night.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The east wind carries him away, and he departs.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It sweeps him out of his place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For God shall cast upon him and not spare.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He would willingly flee out of his hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Men shall clap their hands at him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and hiss him out of his place."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2027.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 27</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Though Job's friends had become silent, and dropped the controversy with him, he still continued his discourse in this and the four following chapters; in which he asserts his integrity; illustrates and confirms his former sentiments; gives further proof of his knowledge of things, natural and divine; takes notice of his former state of prosperity, and of his present distresses and afflictions, which came upon him, notwithstanding his piety, humanity, and beneficence, and his freedom from the grosser acts of sin, both with respect to God and men, all which he enlarges upon. In this chapter he gives his word and oath for it, that he would never belie himself, and own that he was a hypocrite, when he was not, but would continue to assert his integrity, and the righteousness of his cause, as long as he lived (verses 1-6); for to be a hypocrite, and to attempt to conceal his hypocrisy, would be of no advantage to him, either in life, or in death (verses 7-10); and was this his character and case, upon their principles, he could expect no other than to be a miserable man, as wicked men are, who have their blessings turned into curses, or taken away from them, and they removed out of the world in the most awful and terrible manner, and under manifest tokens of the wrath and displeasure of God (verses 11-23).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "the spirit of God" - This is referring to the breath which God gave Job.</p>
  <p>[v.17] - "put it on" - That is, put the clothing on mentioned in verse 16.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - "as a booth that the watchman makes" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "Huts or lodges of boughs were set up in vineyards and orchards by those who had to watch them (see Isaiah 1:8; Lamentations 2:6). They were habitations of the weakest and frailest kind."</p>
