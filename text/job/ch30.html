    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "But now those who are younger than I<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have me in derision,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose fathers I would have disdained<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to put with the dogs of my flock.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Indeed, to what might the strength of their hands profit me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in whom old age had perished?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For lack and famine they were solitary,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They cut up mallows by the bushes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and juniper roots for their food.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They were driven forth from among men<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(they cried after them as after a thief),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> To dwell in the clefts of the valleys,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Among the bushes they brayed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Under the nettles they were collected.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They were children of fools, even children of base men.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They were viler than the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And now I am their song.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, I am their by-word.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They abhor me, they flee far from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they do not spare to spit in my face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Because he has loosened my cord and afflicted me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Upon my right hand rise the youth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They push away my feet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> They mar my path.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They set forward my calamity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have no helper.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Terrors are turned upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They pursue my soul as the wind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my welfare passes away as a cloud.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And now my soul is poured out upon me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> My bones are pierced in me in the night season<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my sinews take no rest.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> By the great force of my disease my garment is changed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It binds me around as the collar of my coat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He has cast me into the mire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I have become like dust and ashes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> I cry to you, and you do not hear me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I stand up, and you do not regard me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> You have become cruel to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With your strong hand you oppose yourself against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride upon it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You dissolve my substance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> For I know that you will bring me to death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the house appointed for all living.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though they cry in his destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Did I not weep for him who was in trouble?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was my soul not grieved for the poor?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> When I looked for good, evil came.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> My bowels boiled and did not rest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The days of affliction came upon me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> I went mourning without the sun.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I stood up and cried in the congregation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> I am a brother to jackals<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a companion to owls.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> My skin is black upon me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my bones are burned with heat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> My harp is also turned to mourning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my pipe into the voice of those who weep."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2030.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 30</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Job in this chapter sets forth his then unhappy state and condition, in contrast with his former state of prosperity described in the preceding chapter: things had taken a strange turn, and were just the reverse of what they were before; he who was before in such high esteem and credit with all sorts of men, young and old, high and low, rich and poor, now is had in derision by the meanest and basest of men, whose characters are described (verses 1-8); and the instances of their contempt of him by words and gestures are given (verses 9-14); he who enjoyed so much ease of mind, and health of body, is now filled with distresses of soul, and bodily diseases (verses 15-19); and he who enjoyed so much of the presence of God, and communion with him, and of his love and favor, was now disregarded, and, as he thought, cruelly used by him, who not only had destroyed his substance, but was about to bring him to the grave (verses 20-24); all which came upon him, though he had a sympathizing heart with the poor, and those who were in trouble, and when he expected better things (verses 25-28); and he closes the chapter, lamenting his sad and sorrowful circumstances (verses 29-31).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "he has loosened my cord" - From Matthew Poole's Commentary: "He has slackened the string (as this word sometimes signifies) of my bow, and so rendered my bow and arrows useless, either to offend others, or to defend myself, i.e. he has deprived me of my strength or defense: so this is opposed to that expression, Job 29:20."</p>
  <p>[v.22] - "substance" - Or, "wisdom."</p>
