  <p>1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "How long will it be before you make an end of words?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Mark, and afterward we will speak.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Why are we counted as beasts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and reputed vile in your sight?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He tears himself in his anger.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall the earth be forsaken for you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Indeed, the light of the wicked shall be put out<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his lamp above him shall be put out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The steps of his strength shall be hindered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For he is cast into a net by his own feet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he walks upon a snare.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The snare shall take him by the heel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the robber shall prevail against him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The snare is laid for him in the ground,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a trap for him in the way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Terrors shall make him afraid on every side<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall chase him at his heels.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> His strength shall be hunger-bitten,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destruction shall be ready at his side.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> It shall devour the strength of his skin.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even the first-born of death shall devour his strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> There shall dwell in his tabernacle that which is no longer his.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> His roots shall be dried up beneath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his branch shall be cut off above.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> His remembrance shall perish from the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall have no name in the street.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He shall be driven from light into darkness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chased out of the world.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He shall have neither son nor posterity among his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor anyone remaining in his dwellings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Those who come after him shall be astonished at his day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as those who went before were terrified.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and this is the place of him who does not know God."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2018.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 18</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter is Bildad's second reply to Job, in which he falls with great fury upon him, very sharply inveighs against him, and very highly charges him; the charges he brings against him are talkativeness and inattention to what was said to him (verses 1-2); contempt of his friends, impatience under his affliction, and pride and arrogance, as if the whole world, the course of nature and providence, and God himself all must give way to him (verses 3-4); nevertheless, he is assured of the miserable state of a wicked man, sooner or later, which is described by the extinction of his light of prosperity (verses 5-6); by the defeat of his counsels, being ensnared in a net laid for him (verses 7-10); by the terrible judgments of the sword, famine, and pestilence, by one or the other of which he is brought to death, the king of terrors (verses 11-14); by the destruction of his habitation and of his posterity, so that he has none to hear his name, or perpetuate his memory (verses 15-17); by his being driven out of the world, leaving no issue behind him, to the astonishment of all who knew him (verses 18-20); and the chapter is closed with this observation, that this is the common case of wicked and irreligious persons (verse 21).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "How long will it be before you make an end of words?" - This can also be read as, "How long will you hunt for words?"</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "destruction" - Or, "calamity."</p>
