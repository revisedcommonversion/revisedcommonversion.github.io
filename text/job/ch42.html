  <p>1 Then Job answered the LORD and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "I know that you can do everything<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that no thought can be withheld from you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Who is he who hides counsel without knowledge?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, I have uttered that which I did not understand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />things too wonderful for me which I did not know.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Hear, I implore you, and I will speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will ask of you, and you declare to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but now my eye sees you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I abhor myself<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and repent in dust and ashes."</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has. 8 Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job." 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as the LORD commanded them. The LORD also accepted Job.</p>

  <p>10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends. The LORD also gave Job twice as much as he had before. 11 Then all his brothers came there to him, along with all his sisters and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they condoled with him and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money and everyone an earring of gold. 12 Thus the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning, for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters. 14 And he called the name of the first Jemima, and the name of the second Kezia, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 15 And in all the land no women were found so fair as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. 16 After this Job lived one hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons' sons, even four generations. 17 And Job died, being old and full of days.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2042.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 42</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains Job's answer to the last speech of the Lord's, in which he acknowledges God's omnipotence, and his certain performance of his purposes and pleasure; admits his own folly and ignorance, and confesses his sins; for which he abhorred himself, and of which he repented, (verses 1-6); it also gives an account of the Lord's decision of the controversy between Job and his friends, blaming them and commending him above them; and ordered them to take sacrifices and go to Job and offer them, who should pray for them and be accepted, which was done (verses 7-9); and it closes with a relation of the great prosperity Job was restored to, in which he lived and died (verses 10-17).</p>
  <p>[v.8] - In this verse, Job is acting as mediator between God and his friends. This is a type of Christ, for He is the true Mediator between God and man (1st Timothy 2:5).</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "The LORD also accepted Job" - LXX: "and he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job."</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Job 8:7.</p>
  <p>[v.16] - "After this" - From the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge: "How long he had lived before his afflictions we cannot tell. If we could rely upon the Septuagint, all would be plain, which adds here, <span class="gr-heb">τὰ δὲ πάντα ἔζησεν ἔτη διακόσια τεσσαράκοντα</span>, 'and all the years he lived were two hundred and forty.'" </p>
  <p>[v.17] - The Septuagint adds an interesting bit of text to the end of this verse, and also the end of this chapter. You can read that text in <a href="../../pages/articles/2023/extra-text-job-septuagint.html">this article</a>.</p>
