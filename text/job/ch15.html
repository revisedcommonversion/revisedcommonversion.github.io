  <p>1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Should a wise man utter vain knowledge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or with speeches with which he can do no good?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> You even cast off fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and restrain prayer before God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For your mouth utters your iniquity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you choose the language of the crafty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your own lips even testify against you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Are you the first man who was born?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or were you made before the hills?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Have you heard the secret of God?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And do you limit wisdom to yourself?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> What do you know that we do not know?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What do you understand which is not in us?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> With us are both the gray headed and very aged men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />much older than your father.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Are the consolations of God small with you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is there any secret thing with you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Why does your heart carry you away?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what do your eyes wink at,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> That you turn your spirit against God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let such words go out of your mouth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> What is man that he should be clean,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who is born of a woman that he should be righteous?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold, he puts no trust in his saints.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The heavens are not even clean in his sight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> How much more abominable and filthy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is man who drinks iniquity like water?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I will show you. Hear me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And that which I have seen, I will declare</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> (Which wise men have told<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from their fathers and have not hid it,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> To whom alone the earth was given,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no stranger passed among them).</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The wicked man travails with pain all his days,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> A dreadful sound is in his ears.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> He does not believe that he shall return out of darkness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he is waited for by the sword.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall prevail against him, as a king ready for the battle.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> For he stretches out his hand against God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strengthens himself against the Almighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He runs upon him with a stiff neck,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the thick bosses of his bucklers,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Because he covers his face with his fatness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and makes collops of fat on his loins.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> And he dwells in desolate cities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in houses which no man inhabits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which are ready to become heaps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall he prolong its perfection upon the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The flame shall dry up his branches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by the breath of his mouth he shall go away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Do not let him who is deceived trust in vanity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for vanity shall be his recompense.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> It shall be accomplished before his time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his branch shall not be green.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cast off his flower as the olive.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> They conceive mischief and bring forth vanity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their belly prepares deceit."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Job's three friends having in their turns attacked him, and he having given answer respectively to them, Eliphaz, who began the attack, first enters the debate with him again, and proceeds upon the same plan as before, and endeavors to defend his former sentiments, falling upon Job with greater vehemence and severity; he charges him with vanity, imprudence, and unprofitableness in his talk, and acting a part unbecoming his character as a wise man; indeed, with impiety and a neglect of religion, or at least as a discourager of it by his words and doctrines, of which his mouth and lips were witnesses against him (verses 1-6); he charges him with arrogance and a high conceit of himself, as if he was the first man that was made, no, as if he was the eternal wisdom of God, and had been in his council; and, to check his vanity, retorts his own words upon him, or however the sense of them (verses 7-10); and also with slighting the consolations of God; upon which he warmly expostulates with him (verses 11-13); and in order to convince him of his self-righteousness, which he thought he was full of, he argues from the angels, the heavens, and the general case of man (verses 14-16); and then he declares from his own knowledge, and from the relation of wise and ancient men in former times, who made it their observation, that wicked men are afflicted all their days, attended with terror and despair, and liable to various calamities (verses 17-24); the reasons of which are their insolence to God, and hostilities committed against him, which they are encouraged in by their prosperous circumstances (verses 25-27); notwithstanding all, their estates, riches, and wealth, will come to nothing (verses 28-30); and the chapter is closed with an exhortation to such, not to feed themselves up with vain hopes, or trust in uncertain riches, since their destruction would be sure, sudden, and terrible (verses 31-35).</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "restrain prayer" - Or, "hinder devotion."</p>
  <p>[v.8] - "the secret of God" - That is, the secret counsel of God.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "his saints" - Or, "his holy ones." This is referring to the angels.</p>
  <p>[v.19] - "the earth" - That is, the land.</p>
  <p>[v.25] - "strengthens himself" - Or, "behaves himself proudly."</p>
  <p>[v.26] - "He runs upon him with a stiff neck" - From the Pulpit commentary: "It is not God who runs upon the wicked man... but the wicked man who rushes furiously against God."</p>
  <p>[v.30] - "by the breath of his mouth he shall go away" - That is, by the breath of God's mouth. Reference, Job 4:9.</p>
