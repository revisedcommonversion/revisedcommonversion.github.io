  <p>1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Can a man be profitable to God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as he who is wise may be profitable to himself?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or is it gain to him that you make your ways perfect?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Will he reprove you for fear of you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will he enter with you into judgment?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Is your wickedness not great<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your iniquities infinite?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For you have taken a pledge from your brother for nothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> You have not given water to the weary to drink<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the honorable man dwelt in it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> You have sent widows away empty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Therefore, snares are around you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sudden fear troubles you,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Or darkness so that you cannot see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and abundance of waters cover you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Is God not in the height of heaven?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And you say, 'How does God know?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Can he judge through the dark cloud?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him so that he does not see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he walks in the circuit of heaven.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Have you marked the old way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which wicked men have trodden?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> They were cut down out of time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their foundation was overflowed with a flood!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They said to God, 'Depart from us,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and, 'What can the Almighty do for us?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Yet he filled their houses with good things.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The righteous see it and are glad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the innocent deride them:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> 'Surely our substance is not cut down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fire consumes their remnant.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Now acquaint yourself with him and be at peace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />By this good shall come to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay up his words in your heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />If you put away iniquity far from your tabernacles,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Then you shall lay up gold as dust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The Almighty shall even be your defense<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall have plenty of silver.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> For then you shall have your delight in the Almighty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall lift up your face to God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> You shall make your prayer to him, and he shall hear you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall pay your vows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> You shall also decree a thing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall be established to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the light shall shine upon your ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> When men are cast down, you shall say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'There is exaltation,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall save the humble person.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> He shall deliver even him who is not innocent.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall be delivered by the pureness of your hands."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2022.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 22</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the third and last reply of Eliphaz to Job, in which he charges him with having too high an opinion of himself, of his holiness and righteousness, as if God was profited by it, and laid thereby under obligation to him, whereas he was not (verses 1-3); and as if he reproved and chastised him, because of his fear of him, whereas it was because of his sins (verses 4-5); an enumeration of which he gives, as of injustice, oppression, cruelty to the poor, and even of atheism and infidelity, for which snares and fears were around him, and various calamities (verses 6-14); and compares his way and course of life to that of the men of the old world, and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, and suggests that his end would be like theirs, unless he repented (verses 15-20); and then concludes with an exhortation to him to return to God by repentance, and to reform, when he should see happy times again, and enjoy much outward and inward prosperity, and be an instrument of doing much good to many (verses 21-30).</p>
