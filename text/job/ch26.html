  <p>1 But Job answered and said,</p>

  <p>2 "How have you helped him who is without power? How do you save the arm that has no strength?</p>

  <p>3 How have you counseled him who has no wisdom? And how have you abundantly declared the thing as it is?</p>

  <p>4 To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you?</p>

  <p>5 Those who are dead tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.</p>

  <p>6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.</p>

  <p>7 He stretches out the north over the empty place and hangs the earth upon nothing.</p>

  <p>8 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>

  <p>9 He holds back the face of his throne and spreads his cloud upon it.</p>

  <p>10 He has encompassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end.</p>

  <p>11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>

  <p>12 He divides the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.</p>

  <p>13 By his Spirit he has garnished the heavens. His hand has formed the crooked serpent.</p>

  <p>14 Behold, these are parts of his ways, and how little a portion is heard of him! But the thunder of his power, who can understand?"</p>

  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10vxh6hTfLpe3LLB5liAQ1VJDorOqv09Era_BKk-fQNA" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 26</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Job, in a very sarcastic manner, rallies Bildad on the weakness and impertinence of his reply, and sets it in a very ridiculous light; showing it to be quite foolish and stupid, and not at all to the purpose, and besides was none of his own, but what he had borrowed from another (verses 1-4); and if it was of any avail in the controversy to speak of the greatness and majesty of God, of his perfections and attributes, of his ways and works, he could say greater and more glorious things of God than he had done, and as he does (verses 5-13); beginning at the lower parts of the creation, and gradually ascending to the superior and celestial ones; and concludes with observing, that, after all, it was but little that was known of God and his ways, by himself, by Bildad, or by any mortal creature (verse 14).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - From the treasury of scripture knowledge: "Bildad had produced no argument to refute Job's doctrine; and therefore, Job ironically admires the assistance which Bildad had given to his friends in their extremity, and the instruction he had afforded him in his perplexity."</p>
