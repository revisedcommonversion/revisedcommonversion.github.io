  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or can you mark when the hinds calve?</p>

  <p>2 Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth?</p>

  <p>3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>

  <p>4 Their young ones become strong, they grow up with corn, they go forth and do not return to them.</p>

  <p>5 Who has sent out the wild donkey free? Or who has loosed the bonds of the wild donkey,</p>

  <p>6 Whose house I have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings?</p>

  <p>7 He scorns the multitude of the city, neither does he regard the crying of the driver.</p>

  <p>8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</p>

  <p>9 Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or abide by your crib?</p>

  <p>10 Can you bind the wild ox with ropes in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?</p>

  <p>11 Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him?</p>

  <p>12 Will you believe him that he will bring home your seed and gather it into your barn?</p>

  <p>13 Did you give the beautiful wings to the peacocks, or wings and feathers to the ostrich,</p>

  <p>14 Which leaves her eggs in the earth, warms them in the dust,</p>

  <p>15 And forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them?</p>

  <p>16 She is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers. Her labor is in vain without fear,</p>

  <p>17 Because God has withheld wisdom from her, neither has he imparted to her understanding.</p>

  <p>18 When she lifts herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider.</p>

  <p>19 Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck with thunder?</p>

  <p>20 Can you make him afraid as a locust? The glory of his nostrils is terrible.</p>

  <p>21 He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength. He goes on to meet the armed men.</p>

  <p>22 He mocks at fear and is not terrified, neither does he turn back from the sword.</p>

  <p>23 The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>

  <p>24 He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he believe that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>

  <p>25 He says among the trumpets, 'Ha, ha,' and he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>

  <p>26 Does the hawk fly by your wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south?</p>

  <p>27 Does the eagle mount up at your command and make her nest on high?</p>

  <p>28 She dwells and abides on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>

  <p>29 From there she seeks the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</p>

  <p>30 Her young ones also sip up blood. And where the slain are, there she is."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YP-_VJWNk84XIk73iieU1fQy5f0lMchGUqwNHZKorN4" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 39</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter treats of various creatures, beasts and birds, which Job had little knowledge of, had no concern in the making of them, and scarcely any power over them; as of the goats and hinds (verses 1-4); of the wild donkey (verses 5-8); of the wild ox (verses 9-12); of the peacock and ostrich (verses 13-18); of the horse (verses 19-25); and of the hawk and eagle (verses 26-30).</p>
  <p>[v.13-17] - As the ostrich is careless with the care of her young, so the sinner without Christ and the wisdom of God neglects the care of his eternal soul.</p>
  <p>[v.30] - "where the slain are, there she is" - Reference, Matthew 24:28; Luke 17:37.</p>
