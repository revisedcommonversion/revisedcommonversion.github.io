    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Do you know the time<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or can you mark when the deer bring forth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Can you number the months that they fulfill?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or do you know the time when they bring forth?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they cast out their sorrows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Their young ones become strong, they grow up with grain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they go forth and do not return to them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Who has sent out the wild donkey free?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or who has loosened the bonds of the wild donkey,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Whose house I have made the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the barren land his dwellings?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He scorns the multitude of the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does he regard the crying of the driver.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The range of the mountains is his pasture,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he searches after every green thing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Will the wild ox be willing to serve you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or abide by your crib?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Can you bind the wild ox with ropes in the furrow?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or will he harrow the valleys after you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Will you trust him because his strength is great?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or will you leave your labor to him?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Will you believe him that he will bring home your seed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gather it into your barn?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Did you give the beautiful wings to the peacocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or wings and feathers to the ostrich,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Which leaves her eggs in the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />warms them in the dust,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And forgets that the foot may crush them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or that the wild beast may break them?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> She is hardened against her young ones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as though they were not hers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her labor is in vain without fear,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Because God has withheld wisdom from her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither has he imparted to her understanding.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> When she lifts herself on high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she scorns the horse and his rider.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Have you given the horse strength?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Have you clothed his neck with thunder?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Can you make him afraid as a locust?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The glory of his nostrils is terrible.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He goes on to meet the armed men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> He mocks at fear and is not terrified,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does he turn back from the sword.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The quiver rattles against him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the glittering spear and the shield.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither does he believe that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> He says among the trumpets, 'Ha, ha,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he smells the battle afar off,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Does the hawk fly by your wisdom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stretch her wings toward the south?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Does the eagle mount up at your command<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make her nest on high?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> She dwells and abides on the rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> From there she seeks the prey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her eyes behold afar off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Her young ones also sip up blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And where the slain are, there she is."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2039.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 39</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter treats of various creatures, beasts and birds, which Job had little knowledge of, had no concern in the making of them, and scarcely any power over them; as of the goats and hinds (verses 1-4); of the wild donkey (verses 5-8); of the wild ox (verses 9-12); of the peacock and ostrich (verses 13-18); of the horse (verses 19-25); and of the hawk and eagle (verses 26-30).</p>
  <p>[v.13-17] - As the ostrich is careless with the care of her young, so the sinner without Christ and the wisdom of God neglects the care of his eternal soul.</p>
  <p>[v.30] - "where the slain are, there she is" - Reference, Matthew 24:28; Luke 17:37.</p>
