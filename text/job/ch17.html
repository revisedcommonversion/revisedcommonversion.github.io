    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Give now a pledge and put me in a surety with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is he who will strike hands with me?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> He who speaks flattery to his friends,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He has made me also a by-word of the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they spit in my face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all my members are like a shadow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Upright men shall be astonished at this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2017.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 17</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Job not only enlarges upon the reason given in the preceding chapter, why he was desirous of an advocate with God, and one to plead his cause with him for him (verse 1); but adds other reasons taken from the usage of his friends, from the impossibility of any but a divine Person being his surety; and of anyone being provided and appointed as such but by God himself; from the insufficiency of his friends to judge of his cause, and from the condition and circumstances he was in (verses 2-7); then he takes notice of the effects his present case would have on good men, that though they might be astonished at it, they would be filled with indignation against hypocrites, and would not be moved and stumbled by his afflictions to apostatize from and desert the good ways of God (verses 8-9); after which he addresses his friends, and either calls upon them to renew the dispute with him, or repent of their notions, and join with him in his sentiments (verse 10); and lastly describes his state and circumstances, according to his apprehension of things, observing the shortness of his life, and the darkness of the dispensation he was under, through one thing and another (verses 11-12); that he had nothing but the grave in view, which, and its attendants, he had made very familiar with him (verses 13-14); and that he had no hope of restoration to a better condition, as to his outward circumstances, and that he, and his hopes his friends would have him entertain, and they also, would go down together to the grave, and there should lie in the dust, and rest together until the morning of the resurrection (verses 15-16).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "My breath is corrupt" - Or, "My spirit is consumed."</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "strike hands with me" - From Matthew Poole's Commentary: "That is, agree and promise, or be surety to me; whereof that was the usual gesture (Proverbs 6:1-2, 17:18, 22:26)."</p>
