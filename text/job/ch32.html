  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2 Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God. 3 Also against his three friends his wrath was kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned Job. 4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he was. 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</p>

  <p>6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, "I am young, and you are very old; therefore, I was afraid and dared not show you my opinion.</p>

  <p>7 I said, 'Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.'</p>

  <p>8 But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.</p>

  <p>9 Great men are not always wise, neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>

  <p>10 Therefore, I said, 'Listen to me. I also will show my opinion.'</p>

  <p>11 Behold, I waited for your words. I gave ear to your reasons while you searched out what to say.</p>

  <p>12 I even attended to you, and behold, there was none of you who convinced Job, or who answered his words,</p>

  <p>13 Lest you should say, 'We have found out wisdom. God thrusts him down, not man.'</p>

  <p>14 Now he has not directed his words against me, neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>

  <p>15 They were amazed. They answered no more. They left off speaking.</p>

  <p>16 Seeing that I had waited (for they did not speak, but stood still, and answered no more),</p>

  <p>17 I will also answer my part and will also show my opinion.</p>

  <p>18 For I am full of matter, and the spirit within me constrains me.</p>

  <p>19 Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent, it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>

  <p>20 I will speak so that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.</p>

  <p>21 Do not let me, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.</p>

  <p>22 For I do not know to give flattering titles. In so doing, my Maker would soon take me away."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>Job's three friends being silenced, and having no more to say in reply to him, Elihu, of whose descent some account is given, a bystander and hearer of the whole dispute between them, rises up as a moderator, and expresses some anger both against them and Job (verses 1-5); he makes an apology for engaging in this controversy, by reason of his youth, and they being advanced in years (verses 6-7); but since there is a spirit in man, that gives understanding to men of every age, and old men are not always wise, he desires they would listen to him while he delivered his sentiments on the subject in debate (verses 8-10); and hopes to be heard patiently, since he had waited until they had said all they had to say, and had closely attended to it, and which fell short of convincing Job; and this he was obliged to say, lest they should be wise in their own conceit, and attribute that to men which belongs to God (verses 11-13); he proposes to take a new method with Job, different from theirs; and now they hearing all this from a young man, they were filled with amazement, and struck with silence; and after he had waited a while to observe whether they would say anything or not, he determined to take his turn, and show his opinion also (verses 14-17); and the rather because he was full of arguments, he was desirous to propose them, and was uneasy until he had brought them out; and which he was resolved to do with all impartiality and integrity (verses 18-22).</p>
