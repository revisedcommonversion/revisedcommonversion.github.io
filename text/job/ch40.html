  <p>1 Moreover, the LORD answered Job and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Shall he who contends with the Almighty instruct him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who reproves God, let him answer it."</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 Then Job answered the LORD and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> "Behold, I am vile.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What shall I answer you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Once I have spoken, but I will not answer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even twice, but I will proceed no further."</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> "Now gird up your loins like a man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will demand of you, and you declare to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Will you also disannul my judgment?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will you condemn me so that you may be righteous?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Have you an arm like God?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Or can you thunder with a voice like his?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Deck yourself now with majesty and excellence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and array yourself with glory and beauty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Cast abroad the rage of your wrath.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold everyone who is proud and abase him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Look at everyone who is proud and bring him low.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Tread down the wicked in their place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Hide them in the dust together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bind their faces in secret.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Then I will also confess to you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that your own right hand can save you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Behold now behemoth, which I made with you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He eats grass like an ox.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Behold now, his strength is in his loins,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He moves his tail like a cedar.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> His bones are like strong pieces of brass.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His bones are like bars of iron.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who made him can make his sword to approach him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Surely the mountains bring him forth food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the beasts of the field play there.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He lies under the shady trees,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the covert of the reed and mire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The shady trees cover him with their shadow.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The willows of the brook encompass him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Behold, he drinks up a river and does not hasten.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He trusts that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> He takes it with his eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His nose pierces through snares."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/job/MHC%20-%20Job%2C%20Chapter%2040.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Job, Chapter 40</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Job is called upon to give in his answer (verses 1-2), which he does in the most humble manner, acknowledging his vileness and folly (verses 3-5); and then the Lord proceeds to give him further conviction of his superior justice and power (verses 6-9); and one thing he proposes to him, to humble the proud, if he could, and then he would acknowledge that his own right hand could save him (verses 10-15); and observes to him another instance of his power in a creature called behemoth, which he had made, and gives a description of (verses 15-24).</p>
  <p>[v.15a] - "behemoth" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">בהמות</span> (be-hay-mohth')—the hippopotamus or Nile-horse (of Egyptian derivation). LXX: "wild beasts." From The Pulpit Commentary: "The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter."</p>
  <p>[v.15b] - "which I made with you" - This text may also be read as, "which I made as well as you," or, "which I made along with you."</p>
