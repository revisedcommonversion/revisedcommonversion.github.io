  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass, that after the year had expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of Ammon and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah and destroyed it. 2 And David took the crown of their king from his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set upon David's head. And he also brought a great quantity of spoil out of the city. 3 And he brought out the people who were in it and cut them with saws, with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines. At that time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, who was of the children of the giant, and they were subdued. 5 And there was war again with the Philistines. And Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff was like a weaver's beam. 6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes numbered twenty-four, six on each hand and six on each foot, and he also was the son of the giant. 7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him. 8 These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</p>
