  <p>1 So all of Israel were reckoned by genealogies, and behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.</p>

  <p>2 Now the first inhabitants who dwelt in their possessions in their cities were the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. 3 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, of the children of Benjamin, of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: 4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah. 5 And of the Shilonites: Asaiah the first-born and his sons. 6 And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brothers, six hundred and ninety. 7 And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah, 8 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah, 9 And their brothers, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty-six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.</p>

  <p>10 And of the priests: Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin, 11 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; 12 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah; and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; 13 And their brothers, heads of the house of their fathers, one thousand seven hundred and sixty, very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.</p>

  <p>14 And of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 15 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; 16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>

  <p>17 And the gatekeepers were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief), 18 Who until now waited in the king's gate eastward. They were gatekeepers in the companies of the children of Levi. 19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle, and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry. 20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him. 21 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper of the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 22 All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their set office. 23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. 24 In four quarters were the gatekeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south. 25 And their brothers, who were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them. 26 For these Levites, the four chief gatekeepers, were in their set office and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 27 And they lodged around the house of God because the charge was upon them and its opening every morning pertained to them.</p>

  <p>28 And some of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by number. 29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, all the instruments of the sanctuary, the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices. 30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. 31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the first-born of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. 32 And others of their brothers, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show-bread to prepare it every sabbath.</p>

  <p>33 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who, remaining in the chambers, were free, for they were employed in that work day and night. 34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations. These dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>35 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah, 36 And his first-born son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38 And Mikloth begot Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brothers at Jerusalem over against their brothers. 39 And Ner begot Kish, Kish begot Saul, and Saul begot Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal. 40 And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal begot Micah. 41 And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 42 And Ahaz begot Jarah, and Jarah begot Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. And Zimri begot Moza. 43 And Moza begot Binea, and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son. 44 And Azel had six sons whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.</p>
