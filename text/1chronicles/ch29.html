  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Furthermore, David the king said to all the congregation, "Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great, for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, the silver for things of silver, the brass for things of brass, iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood, onyx-stones and stones to be set, glittering stones and of diverse colors, and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance. 3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have given from my own possessions of gold and silver for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house: 4 Even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the houses, 5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of craftsmen. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?"</p>

  <p>6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly, 7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, of silver ten thousand talents, of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 Then the people rejoiced, for they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>

  <p>10 Therefore, David blessed the LORD before all the congregation. And David said, "Blessed are you, LORD God of Israel our father, forever and ever. 11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty, for all that is in the heaven and on the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all. 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you reign over all. And in your hand is power and might. And it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name.</p>

  <p>14 "But who am I and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come from you, and of your own we have given you. 15 For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as were all our fathers. Our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is no abiding. 16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. 17 I know also, my God, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy your people who are present here to offer willingly to you. 18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you. 19 And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things and to build the palace for which I have made provision."</p>

  <p>20 And David said to all the congregation, "Now bless the LORD your God." And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD and the king.</p>

  <p>21 And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD and offered burnt-offerings to the LORD on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. 22 And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father and prospered. And all Israel obeyed him. 24 And all the princes, the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>

  <p>26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. Seven years he reigned in Hebron and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 30 With all his reign and his might and the times that went over him, over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
