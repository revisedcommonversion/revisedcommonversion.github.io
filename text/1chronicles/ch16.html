  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 So they brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God. 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 3 And he dealt to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, a loaf of bread, a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.</p>

  <p>4 And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD to record and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-edom; and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 6 Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>

  <p>7 Then on that day, David first delivered this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brothers:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>8&emsp;"Give thanks to the LORD. Call upon his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Make his deeds known among the people.</p>

    <p>9&emsp;Sing to him. Sing psalms to him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Talk of all his wondrous works.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Glory in his holy name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the heart of those rejoice who seek the LORD.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Seek the LORD and his strength.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seek his face continually.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;Remember his wonderful works that he has done,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</p>

    <p>13&emsp;O offspring of Israel his servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;He is the LORD our God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His judgments are in all the earth.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Be mindful always of his covenant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of his oath to Isaac,</p>

    <p>17&emsp;And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law and<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Saying, 'To you I will give the land of Canaan,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the lot of your inheritance,'</p>

    <p>19&emsp;When you were but few,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even a few, and strangers in it.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;And when they went from nation to nation<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from one kingdom to another people,</p>

    <p>21&emsp;He allowed no man to do them wrong.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Indeed, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Saying, 'Do not touch my anointed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do my prophets no harm.'</p>

    <p>23&emsp;Sing to the LORD, all the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Show forth from day to day his salvation.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Declare his glory among the heathen,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his wonderful works among all nations.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He also is to be feared above all gods.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;For all the gods of the people are idols,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD made the heavens.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;Glory and honor are in his presence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />strength and gladness are in his place.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;Give to the LORD, you kindreds of the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />give to the LORD glory and strength.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;Give to the LORD the glory due to his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bring an offering and come before him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;Fear before him, all the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The world also shall be stable so that it cannot be moved.</p>

    <p>31&emsp;Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And let men say among the nations, 'The LORD reigns.'</p>

    <p>32&emsp;Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the fields rejoice and all that is therein.</p>

    <p>33&emsp;Then the trees of the wood shall sing at the presence of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he comes to judge the earth.</p>

    <p>34&emsp;O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For his mercy endures forever.</p>

    <p>35&emsp;And say, 'Save us, O God of our salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that we may give thanks to your holy name<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and glory in your praise.'</p>

    <p>36&emsp;Blessed be the LORD God of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />forever and ever."</p>
  </div>

  <p>And all the people said, "Amen," and praised the LORD.</p>

  <p>37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brothers to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required, 38 And also Obed-edom with their brothers, sixty-eight. Obed-edom the son of Jeduthun and also Hosah were gatekeepers. 39 And David left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, 40 To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel. 41 And with them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD because his mercy endures forever. 42 And with them were Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those who should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.</p>

  <p>43 And all the people departed, each to his house. And David returned to bless his house.</p>
