  <p>1 Moreover, David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals. And this is the number of the workmen according to their service: 2 Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph who prophesied according to the order of the king. 3 Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the LORD. 4 Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 6 All these were under the hands of their father in the music in the house of the LORD with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. 7 So their number, with their brothers who were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all who were skillful, was two hundred and eighty-eight.</p>

  <p>8 And they cast lots, ward against ward, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the scholar.</p>

  <p>9 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah—he, his brothers, and sons were twelve; 10 The third to Zaccur—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 11 The fourth to Izri—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 12 The fifth to Nethaniah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 13 The sixth to Bukkiah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 14 The seventh to Jesharelah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 15 The eighth to Jeshaiah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 16 The ninth to Mattaniah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 17 The tenth to Shimei—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 18 The eleventh to Azareel—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 19 The twelfth to Hashabiah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 20 The thirteenth to Shubael—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 21 The fourteenth to Mattithiah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 22 The fifteenth to Jeremoth—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 23 The sixteenth to Hananiah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 24 The seventeenth to Joshbekashah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 25 The eighteenth to Hanani—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 26 The nineteenth to Mallothi—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 27 The twentieth to Eliathah—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 28 The twenty-first to Hothir—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 29 The twenty-second to Giddalti—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 30 The twenty-third to Mahazioth—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve; 31 And the twenty-fourth to Romamti-ezer—he, his sons, and his brothers were twelve.</p>
