  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 2 And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants and brought gifts.</p>

  <p>3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath as he went to establish his dominion by the Euphrates River. 4 And David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. David also hamstrung all the chariot-horses, but reserved of them one hundred chariots.</p>

  <p>5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men. 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus, and the Syrians became David's servants and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went. 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 8 Likewise, from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought large amounts of brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>

  <p>9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, 10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou), and with him all manner of vessels of gold, silver, and brass. 11 King David also dedicated them to the LORD with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>

  <p>12 Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. 13 And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David wherever he went.</p>

  <p>14 So David reigned over all Israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder, 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests, Shavsha was scribe, 17 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were chief deputies of the king.</p>
