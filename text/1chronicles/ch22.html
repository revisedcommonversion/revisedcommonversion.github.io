  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then David said, "This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel."</p>

  <p>2 And David commanded to assemble the strangers who were in the land of Israel. And he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and also brass in abundance without weight, 4 And also cedar trees in abundance, for the Zidonians and those of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 5 And David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be very magnificent for fame and glory throughout all countries. I will therefore now make preparation for it." So David made abundant preparation before his death.</p>

  <p>6 Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel. 7 And David said to Solomon, "My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God. 8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name because you have shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. And I will give him rest from all his enemies around, for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 10 He shall build a house for my name. And he shall be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.' 11 Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and may you prosper and build the house of the LORD your God as he has said of you. 12 May the LORD give you wisdom and understanding and give you charge concerning Israel so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God. 13 Then you shall prosper if you take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage. Do not dread, nor be dismayed. 14 Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight, for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone, and you may add to them. 15 Moreover, there are workmen with you in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work. 16 Of the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and work, and may the LORD be with you."</p>

  <p>17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 18 "Is the LORD your God not with you? And has he not given you rest on every side? For he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the LORD and before his people. 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of the LORD God to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD."</p>
