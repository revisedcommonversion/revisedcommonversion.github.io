  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Concerning the divisions of the gatekeepers: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 2 And the sons of Meshelemiah were Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Elioenai the seventh. 4 Moreover, the sons of Obed-edom were Shemaiah the first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethaneel the fifth, 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peulthai the eighth, for God blessed him. 6 To Shemaiah his son, sons were also born who ruled throughout the house of their father, for they were mighty men of valor. 7 The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, Elzabad (whose brothers were strong men), Elihu, and Semachiah. 8 All these of the sons of Obed-edom—they, their sons, and their brothers—able men for strength for the service, were sixty-two of Obed-edom. 9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, strong men, eighteen. 10 Hosah, of the children of Merari, also had sons: Simri the chief (for though he was not the first-born, yet his father made him the chief), 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.</p>

  <p>12 Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, even among the chief men, having wards against one another, to minister in the house of the LORD. 13 And they cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate. 14 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots, and his lot came out northward. 15 To Obed-edom southward, and to his sons the house of Asuppim. 16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the way of the ascent, ward against ward. 17 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim, two and two. 18 At Parbar westward, four at the highway, and two at Parbar. 19 These are the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Kore and among the sons of Merari.</p>

  <p>20 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God and over the treasures of the dedicated things. 21 As concerning the sons of Laadan, the sons of the Gershonite, Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite: Jehieli.</p>

  <p>22 The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel his brother, who were over the treasures of the house of the LORD. 23 Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites, 24 Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures. 25 And his brothers, by Eliezer, were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son. 26 This Shelomith and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things which David the king, the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host had dedicated. 27 They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to maintain the house of the LORD. 28 And all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, and whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomith and of his brothers.</p>

  <p>29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. 30 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side of the Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD and in the service of the king. 31 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead. 32 And his brothers, men of valor, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and affairs of the king.</p>
