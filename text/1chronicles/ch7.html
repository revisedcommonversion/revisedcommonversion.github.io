They were valiant men of might in their generations whose number was in the days of David twenty-two thousand and six hundred. 3 And the son of Uzzi: Izrahiah. And the sons of Izrahiah: Michael, Obadiah, Joel, and Ishaiah, five. All of them were chief men. 4 And with them, by their generations, after the house of their fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, thirty-six thousand men, for they had many wives and sons. 5 And their brothers among all the families of Issachar were valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies eighty-seven thousand.</p>

  <p>6 The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, and Jediael, three. 7 And the sons of Bela: Ezbon, Uzzi, Uzziel, Jerimoth, and Iri, five, heads of the house of their fathers, mighty men of valor.

  <p>28 And their possessions and habitations were Beth-el and its towns, and eastward Naaram, and westward Gezer with its towns, Shechem also and its towns, to Gaza and its towns, 29 And by the borders of the children of Manasseh, Beth-shean and its towns, Taanach and its towns, Megiddo and its towns, and Dor and its towns.
