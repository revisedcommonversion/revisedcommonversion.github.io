  <p>1 Now Benjamin begot Bela his first-born, Ashbel the second, Aharah the third, 2 Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth. 3 And the sons of Bela were Addar, Gera, Abihud, 4 Abishua, Naaman, Ahoah, 5 Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram. 6 And these are the sons of Ehud, who are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they carried them captive to Manahath: 7 Naaman, Ahiah, and Gera—he carried them captive and begot Uzza and Ahihud. 8 And Shaharaim begot children in the country of Moab after he had sent them away. Hushim and Baara were his wives. 9 And he begot of Hodesh his wife: Jobab, Zibia, Mesha, Malcham, 10 Jeuz, Shachia, and Mirma. These were his sons, heads of the fathers. 11 And of Hushim he begot Ahitub and Elpaal. 12 The sons of Elpaal: Eber, Misham, Shamed (who built Ono and Lod, with its town), 13 Beriah and Shema (who were heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Ajalon, who drove away the inhabitants of Gath), 14 And Ahio, Shashak, Jeremoth. 15 Zebadiah, Arad, Ader, 16 Michael, Ispah, and Joha were the sons of Beriah. 17 And Zebadiah, Meshullam, Hezeki, Heber, 18 Ishmerai, Jezliah, and Jobab were the sons of Elpaal. 19 And Jakim, Zichri, Zabdi, 20 Elienai, Zilthai, Eliel, 21 Adaiah, Beraiah, and Shimrath were the sons of Shimhi. 22 And Ishpan, Heber, Eliel, 23 Abdon, Zichri, Hanan, 24 Hananiah, Elam, Antothijah, 25 Iphedeiah, and Penuel were the sons of Shashak. 26 And Shamsherai, Shehariah, Athaliah, 27 Jaresiah, Eliah, and Zichri were the sons of Jeroham. 28 These were heads of the fathers by their generations, chief men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>29 And at Gibeon the father of Gibeon dwelt, whose wife's name was Maachah, 30 And his first-born son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Nadab, 31 Gedor, Ahio, and Zacher. 32 And Mikloth begot Shimeah. And these also dwelt with their brothers in Jerusalem over against them.</p>

  <p>33 And Ner begot Kish, Kish begot Saul, and Saul begot Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal. 34 And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal begot Micah. 35 And the sons of Micah were Pithon, Melech, Tarea, and Ahaz. 36 And Ahaz begot Jehoadah, and Jehoadah begot Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. And Zimri begot Moza. 37 And Moza begot Bineah. Rapha was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 38 And Azel had six sons whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel. 39 And the sons of Eshek his brother were Ulam his first-born, Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 40 And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and had many sons and sons' sons numbering one hundred and fifty. All these are of the sons of Benjamin.</p>
