  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, the captains over the thousands, captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king and of his sons, with the officers, with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men to Jerusalem. 2 Then David the king stood upon his feet and said, "Hear me, my brothers and my people. As for me, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building. 3 But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for my name because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.' 4 However, the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for he has chosen Judah to be the ruler, and of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father he approved me to make me king over all Israel. 5 And of all my sons (for the LORD has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 6 And he said to me, 'Solomon your son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son and I will be his father. 7 Moreover, I will establish his kingdom forever if he is constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.' 8 Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God so that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you forever.</p>

  <p>9 "And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. 10 Take heed now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it."</p>

  <p>11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, of its houses, of its treasuries, of its upper chambers, of its inner parlors, and of the place of the mercy-seat, 12 And the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things, 13 And also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. 14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service, and also silver for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service, 15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick and for its lamps, and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick and also for its lamps, according to the use of every candlestick. 16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of show-bread, for every table, and likewise silver for the tables of silver. 17 He also gave pure gold for the flesh-hooks, the bowls, and the cups. And for the golden basins he gave gold by weight for every basin, and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver. 18 And for the altar of incense he gave refined gold by weight. And he gave gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>

  <p>19 "All this," David said, "the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern."</p>

  <p>20 And David said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and of good courage, and do it. Do not fear, nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, even my God, will be with you. He will not fail you, nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. 21 And behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with you for all the service of the house of God. And there shall be with you for all manner of workmanship every willing skillful man for any manner of service. Also, the princes and all the people will be wholly at your command."</p>
