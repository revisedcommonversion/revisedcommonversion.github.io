    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">John exhorts a certain honorable matron and her children to persevere in Christian love and belief, 1-7, lest they lose the reward of their former profession, 8, 9; and to have nothing to do with those seducers who do not bring the true doctrine of Christ Jesus, 10-13.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those who have known the truth, 2 For the truth's sake which dwells in us and shall be with us forever: 3 Grace, mercy, and peace shall be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>

  <p>4 I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 5 And now I implore you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 6 And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p>

  <p>7 For many deceivers have entered into the world who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 8 Look to yourselves so that we do not lose those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 9 Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, neither wish him happiness. 11 For he who wishes him happiness is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>

  <p>12 Having many things to write to you, I do not wish to write with paper and ink. But I trust to come to you and speak face to face so that our joy may be full.</p>

  <p>13 The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</p>
