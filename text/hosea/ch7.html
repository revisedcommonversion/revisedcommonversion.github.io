    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And they do not consider in their hearts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I remember all their wickedness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now their own doings have beset them around.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are before my face.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> They make the king glad with their wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the princes with their lies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They are all adulterers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as an oven heated by the baker<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who ceases to stir the fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> In the day of our king<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their baker sleeps all the night.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They are all hot as an oven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have devoured their judges.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All their kings have fallen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no one among them who calls to me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Strangers have devoured his strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he does not know it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even gray hairs are here and there upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet he does not know.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And the pride of Israel testifies to his face.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they do not return to the LORD their God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor seek him for all this.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Ephraim is also like a silly dove without heart.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They call to Egypt. They go to Assyria.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> When they go, I will spread my net upon them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will bring them down as the birds of the heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Woe to them! For they have fled from me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Destruction to them!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For they have transgressed against me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Though I have redeemed them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they have spoken lies against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And they have not cried to me with their heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when they howled upon their beds.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They assemble themselves for grain and wine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they rebel against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Though I have bound and strengthened their arms,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they devise mischief against me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> They return, but not to the most High.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are like a deceitful bow.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter either begins a new sermon, discourse, or prophecy, or it is a continuation of the former; at least it seems to be of the same argument with the latter part of it, only it is directed to Israel alone; and consists of complaints against them because of their manifold sins, and of denunciations of punishment for them. They are charged with ingratitude to God, sinning in a daring manner against mercy, and with falsehood, thefts, and robberies (Hosea 7:1); with lack of consideration of the omniscience of God, and his notice of their sins, which surrounded them (Hosea 7:2); with flattery to their king and princes (Hosea 7:3); with adultery, which lust raged in them like a heated oven (Hosea 7:4); with drunkenness, aggravated by drawing their king into it (Hosea 7:5); with raging lusts, which devoured their judges, made their kings to fall, and brought on such a general corruption, that there were none who called upon the Lord (Hosea 7:6-7); with mixing themselves with the nations of the earth, and so learning their ways, and bringing their superstition and idolatry into the worship of God, so that they were nothing in religion, like a half baked cake (Hosea 7:8); with stupidity and insensibility of their declining state (Hosea 7:9); with pride, impenitence, and stubbornness (Hosea 7:10); with folly, in seeking to Egypt and Assyria for help, and not to the Lord; for which they would be taken as birds in a net, and sorely chastised (Hosea 7:11-12); with ingratitude, hypocrisy, and deceitfulness; for all which they are threatened with destruction (Hosea 7:13-16).</p>
  <p>[v.8] - From the Geneva Bible study notes: "That is, he counterfeits the religion of the Gentiles, yet is but as a cake baked on the one side, and raw on the other, that is, neither thoroughly hot nor thoroughly cold, but partly a Jew and partly a Gentile." This is very similar to the accusation Jesus mad to the church of the Laodiceans in Revelation 3:14-22. Israel was chosen to be a peculiar people to the Lord (Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 14:2, 26:18; Psalm 135:4), but in this verse, God says they differ nothing from the other, that is, uncircumcised, nations (see Genesis 17:10-14 where God distinguishes His people through the token of circumcision).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "silly dove" - That is, a dove deceived by various lures, or in other words, they were enticed by flatteries.</p>
