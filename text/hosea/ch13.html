  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter begins with observing the different state and condition of Ephraim before and after his idolatry (verse 1); his increase in it (verse 2); and therefore his prosperity was very short lived, which is signified by various metaphors (verse 3); and his sins are aggravated by the former goodness of God to him, his great ingratitude to God, and forgetfulness of him (verses 4-6); hence he is threatened with his wrath and vengeance in a very severe manner (verses 7-8); for which he had none to blame but himself; indeed, such was the grace and goodness of God to him, that though he had destroyed himself, yet there were help and salvation for him in [God] (verse 9); though not in his king he had desired, and was given, and was taken away in wrath (verses 10-11); but his sin being bound up and hid, and he foolish and unwise, sharp corrections would be given to him (verses 12-13); and yet a gracious promise is made of redemption from death and the grave by the Messiah (verse 14); but, notwithstanding this, and all his present prosperity, he would be blasted in his wealth and riches; and Samaria the metropolis of his country would he desolate; and the inhabitants of it be used in the most cruel manner, because of their rebellion against God (verses 15-16).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "They say of them, 'Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.'" - This may also be read as, "They say one to another, while they immolate men, 'Let them kiss the calves.'" This passage condemns the practice of kissing idols(i.e., giving adoration to idols), as in 1st Kings 19:18; Job 31:26-28, and the appeasement of idols by burning people, especially children, as sacrifices to them, as in Leviticus 18:21; Deuteronomy 18:10; 2nd Kings 16:3, 17:17, 21:6, 23:10; 2nd Chronicles 33:6; Jeremiah 32:35; Ezekiel 16:21, 20:26, 31.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Reference, Deuteronomy 32:15.</p>
  <p>[v.7-8] - Reference, Psalm 18:26.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Reference, Isaiah 59:1-2.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Reference, 1st Samuel 8:7.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - Quoted in 1st Corinthians 15:55.</p>
