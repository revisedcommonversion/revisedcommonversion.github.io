  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span style="font-style:italic;">The word of the LORD that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 [<span style="font-style:italic;">The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea.</span>] And the LORD said to Hosea, "Go take for yourself a wife addicted to lewdness and children of lewdness, for the land has committed great lewdness, departing from the LORD." 3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son. 4 And the LORD said to him, "Call his name Jezreel, for yet a little while and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease. 5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."</p>

  <p>6 And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And God said to him, "Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly take them away. 7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, by sword, by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen."</p>

  <p>8 Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. 9 Then God said, "Call his name Lo-ammi, for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.</p>

  <p>10 "Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there it shall be said to them, 'You are the sons of the living God.'</p>

  <p>11 Then the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be assembled and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up from the land, for the day of Jezreel shall be great."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/hosea/MHC%20-%20Hosea%2C%20Chapter%2001.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Hosea, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After the general inscription of the book, in which the author, penman, and time of this prophecy, are expressed (Hosea 1:1), the people of Israel are reproved for their idolatry, under the representation of a harlot the prophet is bid to marry, which he is said to do (Hosea 1:2-3), and their ruin and destruction are foretold in the names of the children he had by her, and by what is said on the occasion of the birth of each (Hosea 1:4-6, 8-9), but mercy and salvation are promised to Judah (Hosea 1:7), and the chapter is concluded with a glorious prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles, and the calling of the Jews in the latter day; and of the union of Judah and Israel under one Head and Savior, Christ; and of the greatness and glory of that day (Hosea 1:10-11).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "Hosea" - From John Gill's Exposition: "Whose name is the same with Joshua and Jesus, and signifies a savior; he was in some things a type of Christ the Savior, and prophesied of him, and salvation by him; and was the instrument and means of saving men, as all true prophets were, and faithful ministers of the word are: to him the word of the Lord, revealing his mind and will, was brought by the Spirit of God, and impressed upon his mind; and it was committed to him to be delivered to others."</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "Lo-ruhamah" - That is, "Not beloved."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "Lo-ammi" - That is, "Not my people."</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoted in Romans 9:26.</p>
