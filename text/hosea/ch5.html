  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The design of this chapter is to expose the sins of Israel and of Judah, and to declare the judgment of God upon them for them. Men of all ranks in Israel are summoned to attend to the charge brought against then, and the sentence on them (Hosea 5:1). The charge exhibited is, that they were guilty of sin, hating men to the slaughter of idolatrous sacrifices, though they had been sufficiently rebuked and corrected (Hosea 5:1-2); of both corporeal and spiritual adultery, whereby they were defiled, and which was well known to the Lord (Hosea 5:3); of obstinate persistence in impenitence, owing to the efficacy of an unclean spirit in them, and their lack of the knowledge of God (Hosea 5:4); of open pride, which stared them in the face, and for which they fell into calamities, and Judah with them, and should not be able with all their sacrifices to find favor with God, who had withdrawn himself from them (Hosea 5:5-6); also of treacherous dealing with the Lord by their spiritual adultery, and begetting strange children (Hosea 5:7); next their punishment is denounced, of which notice was to be given them by the sound of the trumpet, as an alarm of war, or as calling for mourning (Hosea 5:8); since Ephraim would become desolate, of which notification had been made among the tribes (Hosea 5:9); and wrath would be poured out in great abundance on the princes of Judah, who were very wicked men (Hosea 5:10); and Ephraim would be oppressed and broken by the judgment of God, who would be as a moth to them, and also rottenness to Judah, because they followed the commandments of men (Hosea 5:11-12); and, what was still more provoking, when they were sensible of their calamities and distresses, they did not seek help from the Lord, but from men who could do them no good; and therefore he threatens to be as a devouring lion to them (Hosea 5:13-14); and yet the chapter concludes with a promise of the conversion of these people, after the Lord had dealt with them in an angry manner (Hosea 5:15).</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "They will not frame their doings to turn to their God" - This may also be read as, "They will not apply their endeavors to turn to their God." In other words, they had no inclination, they had no thought, care, or concern, to repent of their superstitions and sins and turn to their God.</p>
  <p>[v.7a] - "They have dealt treacherously against the LORD" - This may also be read as, "They have been unfaithful to the LORD."</p>
  <p>[v.7b] - "for they have begotten strange children" - That is, they led their children to also be unfaithful to God.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which shall surely be" - This may also be read as, "Among the tribes of Israel I have made known the truth."</p>
  <p>[v.12] - The idea behind this verse is that the people would be slowly consumed like a moth to a cloth and pine away until they become wholly rotten. To contrast with the deluge mentioned in verse 10, we can see that God can either pour out His wrath or choose to slowly chastise us. Either way, the design is to bring us to repentance.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - When the slow chastisements do not break our obstinancy, God then will be to us as a lion. Instead of a slow consumption as with a moth, He then turns to quick, utter consumption. Reference, Deuteronomy 4:24; Job 10:16; Lamentations 3:10; Hebrews 12:29.</p>
