    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Say to your brothers, 'Ammi,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to your sisters, 'Ruhamah.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Plead with your mother.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Plead, for she is not my wife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither am I her husband.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let her therefore put away her prostitutions out of her sight<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her adulteries from between her breasts,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Lest I strip her naked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />set her as in the day that she was born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />make her as a wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set her like a dry land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and kill her with thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And I will not have mercy upon her children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are the children of lewdness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> For their mother has played the harlot.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She who conceived them has done shamefully.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For she said, 'I will go after my lovers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who give me my bread and my water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Therefore, behold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will hedge up your way with thorns<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make a wall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that she shall not find her paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And she shall follow after her lovers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but she shall not overtake them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she shall seek them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but shall not find them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then she shall say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I will go and return to my first husband,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for then it was better with me than now.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> For she did not know that I gave her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />grain, wine, and oil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and multiplied her silver and gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which they prepared for Baal.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Therefore, I will return<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take away my grain in its time<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my wine in its season,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will recover my wool and my flax<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />given to cover her nakedness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And now I will disclose her lewdness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the sight of her lovers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no one shall deliver her out of my hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> I will also cause to cease all her mirth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />her feast days, her new moons, her sabbaths,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all her solemn feasts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> And I will destroy her vines and her fig-trees,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of which she has said, 'These are my rewards<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that my lovers have given me.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will make them a forest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which she burned incense to them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she went after her lovers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and forgot me," says the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "Therefore, behold, I will allure her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />bring her into the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and speak comfortably to her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And I will give her her vineyards from there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the valley of Achor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a door of hope.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And she shall sing there,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as in the days of her youth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as in the day when she came<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the land of Egypt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And it shall be at that day," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"that you shall call me Ishi,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall no longer call me Baali.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall no longer be remembered by their name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And in that day I will make a covenant for them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the beasts of the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the birds of heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with the creeping animals of the ground.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will break the bow, the sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the battle out of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will make them to lie down in safety.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> And I will betroth you to me forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will even betroth you to me in righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in judgment, in loving-kindness, and in mercies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you shall know the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will hear," says the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"I will hear the heavens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall hear the earth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> And the earth shall hear the grain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the wine, and the oil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall hear Jezreel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> And I will sow her for myself in the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will have mercy upon her who had not obtained mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will say to those who were not my people, 'You are my people.'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall say, 'You are my God.'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter is an explanation of the former, proceeding upon the same argument in more express words. The godly Israelites are here called upon to lay before the body of the people their idolatry, ingratitude, obstinacy, and ignorance of the God of their mercies; and to exhort them to repentance, lest they should be stripped of all their good things, and be brought into great distress and difficulties; all their joy and comfort cease, and be exposed to shame and contempt (Hosea 2:1-13), yet, notwithstanding, many gracious promises are made to them, of their having the alluring and comfortable word of the Gospel; of a door of hope; of salvation being opened to them; of faith in the Lord, and affection to him as their husband; of the removal of all idolatry from them; of safety from all enemies; of their open espousal to Christ; of his hearing of their prayers, and giving them plenty of all good things; and of their multiplication, conversion, and covenant relation to God (Hosea 2:14-23).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - Ammi: My people. Ruhamah: Beloved.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - "For she said" - This may also be read as, "For she purposed," or, "For she resolved within herself." The idea is that the going after of her lovers was premeditated.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "my first husband" - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "Jesus was, and is, and ever will be, the first, and constant, and last, and only husband of his Church. For whatever idols our poor souls, in the fallen state of an unregenerated, unrenewed nature, through the temptation of hell, may go after, still the Lord Jesus loses not his right in us, neither we our interest in him."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "recover" - This can also be read as, "take away by force," as in, "I will take away by force my wool and my flax, etc."</p>
  <p>[v.16a] - Ishi: My husband. Baali: My lord, or, my Baal.</p>
  <p>[v.16b] - "Ishi" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">אישי</span> (i-shee'). From John Gill's Exposition: "Or, 'my husband'; returning to Christ their first husband, and being received by him, shall have faith and interest in him, and full assurance of it; and shall not only be allowed to call him their husband, but in the strength of faith, and with great freedom of soul, shall call him so, and say as the church did, 'my beloved is mine, and I am his' (Song of Solomon 2:16): or, 'my man'; the man the Lord, the man Yahweh's fellow, Immanuel God with us, God in human nature; and so more manifestly points at Christ, who, most properly speaking, stands in the relation of a husband to his people: or, 'my strength', as some interpret it; the husband being the strength, protection, and defense of the wife, the weaker vessel; so Christ is the strength of his saints, in whom they have righteousness and strength, and through whose strength they can do all things."</p>
  <p>[v.16c] - "Baali" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">בעלי</span> (bah-al-ee'). From the Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary: "Ba'al is not to be taken as an appellative in the sense of master, as distinguished from 'ish, man, i.e., husband, for ba'al does not mean master or lord, but owner, possessor... Moreover, the context in this instance, especially the Be'alim in Hosea 2:19, decidedly requires that Ba'al should be taken as a proper name. Calling or naming is a designation of the nature or the true relation of a person or thing. The church calls God her husband, when she stands in the right relation to Him; when she acknowledges, reveres, and loves Him, as He has revealed Himself, i.e., as the only true God. On the other hand, she calls Him Baal, when she places the true God on the level of the Baals, either by worshipping other gods along with Jehovah, or by obliterating the essential distinction between Jehovah and the Baals, confounding together the worship of God and idolatrous worship, the Jehovah-religion and heathenism."</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Quoted in Romans 9:25; 1st Peter 2:10.</p>
