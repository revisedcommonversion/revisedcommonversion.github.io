  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Hear the word of the LORD, children of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because there is no truth, nor mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; "By swearing, lying, killing, stealing, and committing adultery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they break out, and blood touches blood.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Therefore, the land shall mourn,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and everyone who dwells in it shall languish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the beasts of the field and with the birds of heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even the fish of the sea shall also be taken away.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Yet let no man contend, nor reprove another,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for your people are as those who contend with the priest.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Therefore, you shall fall in the day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will destroy your mother.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Because you have rejected knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also reject you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you shall be no priest to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seeing you have forgotten the law of your God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also forget your children.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; As they were increased, so they sinned against me;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I will change their glory into shame.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; They eat up the sin of my people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; And it shall be, as the people, so shall be the priest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will punish them for their ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and reward them for their doings.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;For they shall eat and not have enough.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be guilty of lewdness and shall not increase,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have ceased to take heed to the LORD.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Lewdness, wine, and new wine take away the heart.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;My people ask counsel at their stocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their staff declares to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the spirit of lewdness has caused them to err,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they have gone astray from under their God.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and burn incense upon the hills,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />under oaks, poplars, and elms,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because their shade is agreeable.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, your daughters shall be guilty of lewdness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;I will not punish your daughters when they are guilty of lewdness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor your spouses when they commit adultery,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they themselves are separated with prostitutes<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they sacrifice with harlots.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, the people who do not understand shall fall.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Though you, Israel, play the harlot,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet do not let Judah offend,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not come to Gilgal,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither go up to Beth-aven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor swear, 'The LORD lives.'</p>

    <p>16&emsp;For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Ephraim is joined to idols.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Leave him alone.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Their drink is sour.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have been guilty of lewd deeds continually.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her rulers have thoroughly loved shame.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;The wind has bound her up in her wings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/hosea/MHC%20-%20Hosea%2C%20Chapter%2004.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Hosea, Chapter 4</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains a new sermon or prophecy, delivered in proper and express words, without types and figures, as before; in which the people of Israel are summoned to appear at the tribunal of God, to hear the charge brought against them, and the sentence to be pronounced upon them, and which would be executed. They are charged with sins of omission and commission; with lack of truth and mercy to men, and with ignorance of God; with swearing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery (Hosea 4:1-2), the punishment threatened is the sword, famine, and pestilence; which should affect the whole land, and all creatures in it, men, beasts, fowls, and fishes (Hosea 4:3), then the priests and false prophets are threatened with falling into calamities along with the people, and with rejection from their office, and forgetfulness of their posterity, and a taking away their glory from them, because of their striving with the true prophets; their rejection of knowledge; forgetfulness of the law of God; covetousness, adultery, and drunkenness (Hosea 4:4-11), then the discourse is turned to the people again, who are charged with divination and idolatry, which is spiritual adultery; and therefore, by way of retaliation, their wives and daughters would be left to commit adultery and fornication (Hosea 4:12-14), and the chapter is concluded with advice to Israel not to tempt Judah to sin; or to Judah not to do the same, after the example of Israel, who were backsliders, idolaters, left of God and alone; guilty of bribery, and similar shameful things, and would be suddenly filled with shame (Hosea 4:15-19).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "shall languish" - This may also be read as, "shall be cut off," or, "shall be destroyed."</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "those who contend with the priest" - This may also be read as, "those who rebuke the priest."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - This verse was originally worded, "And there shall be, like people, like priest..." It was modified for readability.</p>
  <p>[v.12a] - "stocks" - That is, "wood," or in other words, "idols," or, "fictitious gods."</p>
  <p>[v.12b] - "from under their God" - That is, from under the government of God. From John Calvin's Commentary: "When we abide then under the government of our God, and with fixed eyes look on him, then we chastely preserve our faithfulness to him. But when we follow idols, we then play the wanton and depart from God."</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "Beth-aven" - From John Gill's Exposition: "Beth-aven is the same with Bethel, the name Jacob gave it (Genesis 28:17), signifying the house of God; but when Jeroboam set up one of his calves here, the prophets, by way of contempt, called it Beth-aven, the house of iniquity, or the house of an idol."</p>
  <p>[v.16a] - "a backsliding heifer" - In this verse, backsliding can mean to be undisciplined, unruly, or uncontrollable.</p>
  <p>[v.16b] - "in a large place" - That is, in a spacious place.</p>
