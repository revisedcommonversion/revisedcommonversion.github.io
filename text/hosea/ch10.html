    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Their heart is divided.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Now they shall be found faulty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall break down their altars.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall destroy their images.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For now they shall say,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"We have no king<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because we did not fear the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What then should a king do to us?"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> They have spoken words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />swearing falsely in making a covenant.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus judgment springs up as hemlock<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the furrows of the field.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the calves of Beth-aven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For its people shall mourn over it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and also its priests who rejoiced over it for its glory,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because it has departed from it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> It shall also be carried to Assyria<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for a present to king Jareb.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ephraim shall receive shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> As for Samaria, her king is cut off<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the foam upon the water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be destroyed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall say to the mountains, "Cover us,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and to the hills, "Fall on us."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> "O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There they stood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />did not overtake them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> It is in my desire that I should chastise them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the people shall be gathered against them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when they bind themselves in their two furrows.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter is of the same argument with the former, and others before that; setting forth the sins of the ten tribes, and threatening them with the judgments of God for them; and exhorting them to repentance, and works of righteousness. They are charged with unfruitfulness and ingratitude; increasing in idolatry, as they increased in temporal good things (verse 1); with a divided heart, and with irreverence of God, and their king; and with false swearing, covenant breaking, and injustice (verses 2-4); and are threatened with a removal of their king, and with the destruction of their idols, and places of idolatry, which should cause fear in the common people, and mourning among the priests (verses 5-8). It is observed, that their sin had been of long continuance, though the Lord had been kind and good to them, in chastising them in love, giving them good laws, sending his prophets to exhort them to repentance and reformation, but all in vain (verses 9-13); therefore they are threatened with the spoiling of their fortresses, the destruction of the people, and the cutting off of their king (verses 14-15).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "Israel is an empty vine that brings forth fruit to himself" - This may also be read as, "Israel is like a robbed vine. He will lay up fruit for himself."</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "Their heart is divided" - That is, their heart is divided from God. It is as if they withdrew their heart from God.</p>
  <p>[v.4a] -"They have spoken words" - These are vain and empty words.</p>
  <p>[v.4b] - "hemlock" - Or, wormwood. Either way, the reference is to some bitter plant.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Foam appears to have substance, but is mostly empty and has nothing substantial in it.</p>
  <p>[v.8a] - "Aven" - This is the same as Bethel, and has been called Beth-aven, or the house of iniquity, before (Hosea 4:18, 5:8, 10:5; see also the notes for Hosea 4:18).</p>
  <p>[v.8b] - Quoted in Luke 23:30.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "furrows" - This word can also be read as, "iniquities," as in, "when they bind themselves in their two iniquities." That reading might make more sense, but the verse can be explained with either of the two words. If read with <span class="it">furrows</span>, this shows that the Israelites "did not plough in one furrow, or keep in the true and pure worship of God; but made two furrows, worshiping partly God, and partly idols" (John Gill). If read with <span class="it">iniquities</span>, this means "either their worshiping the two calves at Daniel and Bethel; or their corporeal and spiritual adultery; or their forsaking the true God, and worshiping idols" (John Gill).</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Quoted in 2nd Corinthians 9:10.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - "Shalman" - This may be a simplified form of the name of Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, mentioned in 2nd Kings 17:3, 18:9. But as to the events mentioned in this verse that concern him, they may be of some history not recorded in Scripture, but known by Hosea.</p>
