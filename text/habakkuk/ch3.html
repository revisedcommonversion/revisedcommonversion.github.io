  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> O LORD, I have heard your speech and was afraid.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O LORD, revive your work in the midst of the years.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the midst of the years make it known.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In wrath remember mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> God came from Teman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the Holy One from mount Paran.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>] <br />His glory covered the heavens,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the earth was full of his praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And his brightness was as the light.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He had rays coming out of his hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there was the hiding of his power.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Before him went the pestilence<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> He stood and measured the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He beheld and drove apart the nations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The everlasting mountains were scattered<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the perpetual hills bowed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His ways are everlasting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Was the LORD displeased with the rivers?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was your anger against the rivers?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was your wrath against the sea that you rode upon your horses<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your chariots of salvation?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Your bow was made quite ready,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>] <br />You cleaved the earth with rivers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The mountains saw you and they trembled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The overflowing of the water passed by.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The sun and moon stood still in their habitation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At the light of your arrows they went,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and at the shining of your glittering spear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> You marched through the land in indignation.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You threshed the heathen in anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You went forth for the salvation of your people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even for salvation with your anointed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You wounded the head of the house of the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by uncovering the foundation to the neck.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[<span class="it">Selah.</span>]</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You struck through with his staffs the head of his villages.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> You walked through the sea with your horses,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through the heap of great waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> When I heard, my belly trembled.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />My lips quivered at the voice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Rottenness entered into my bones,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I trembled in myself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I might rest in the day of trouble.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When he comes up to the people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he will invade them with his troops.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Though the fig-tree does not blossom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and no fruit is on the vines,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though the labor of the olive fails<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fields yield no food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />though the flock is cut off from the fold<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no herd in the stalls,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Yet I will rejoice in the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The LORD God is my strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will make my feet like those of a doe<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make me to walk upon my high places.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The title of this chapter is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, composed after the manner of a psalm of David, and directed to the chief singer (verses 1, 19). The occasion of it is expressed (verse 2); in which the prophet declares his concern for the work of the Lord, and the promotion of the kingdom and interest of Christ; and observes the various steps that were, or would be, taken for the advancement of it; for which he prays, and suggests that these would be after the manner of the Lord's dealing with the people of Israel, and settling them in the land of Canaan (verses 3-15); and there being several things awful in this account, both with respect to the judgments of God on his enemies, and the conflicts and trials of his own people, it greatly affected the mind of the prophet (verse 16); and yet, in the view of the worst, he expresses his strong faith in the Lord, as to better times and things, that would most assuredly come (verses 17-19).</p>
  <p>[v.2a] - "speech" - Or, "voice."</p>
  <p>[v.2b] - "revive" - Or, "preserve."</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "rays" - Originally, "horns," but here, "rays of light," is meant.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - This verse is rendered in various ways. The American Standard Version is, "Before him went the pestilence, and fiery bolts went forth at his feet." John Owen rendered it, "From before him proceeded the word (i.e., the law), and forth came lightning at his feet." Others substitute "burning coals" with, "plague," or "pestilence," and render the verse to say that pestilence went before him and plague followed him.</p>
  <p>[v.9a] - "quite ready" - Literally, "quite bare." The idea is that the bow has been made bare by being pulled out of its sheath, and therefore, it is ready for use.</p>
  <p>[v.9b] - "according to the oaths of the tribes, even your word" - It seems as if every English translation has a different rendering of this text. The Pulpit Commentary agrees with the KJV, but then adds, "the Hebrew text is corrupt, and cannot be explained with any certainty." The ASV renders the text as, "the oaths to the tribes were a sure word." The word, <span class="it">tribes</span>, can also be translated to shafts, rods, or arrows, and the phrase, <span class="it">even your word</span>, can be translated as appointment, decree, or command. With those two alternate translations, the Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Lexicon offers this rendering of the text: "Sworn are the rods (or, arrows) of appointment." Though that rendering is given, the BDB Lexicon states that the text is not reliable.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "The overflowing of the water passed by" - John Calvin said that this text is applied to the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-31) and the crossing of the Jordan into Canaan (Joshua 3:14-17).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "The sun and moon stood still in their habitation" - Reference, Joshua 10:12-14.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Psalm 44:5.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - "villages" - The Hebrew word here can refer to two different things, though the overall meaning doesn't change too much. It can refer to what is here used, <span class="it">villages</span>, as in an open unfortified village (John Owen). It can also refer to the inhabitants of a village, for the Hebrew word is in the masculine form (the feminine form is used to refer to cities and towns), and in this case, it can be translated as warriors, leaders, or inhabitants (Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Lexicon; John Calvin). The ASV renders the word as <span class="it">warriors</span>.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - "through the heap of great waters" - The Pulpit Commentary offers this alternate rendering of this text: "upon the surge of mighty waters."</p>
