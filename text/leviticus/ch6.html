  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "If a soul sins and commits a trespass against the LORD and lies to his neighbor in that which was delivered him to keep, in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or has deceived his neighbor, 3 Or has found that which was lost and lies concerning it and swears falsely, in any of all these that a man does, sinning therein, 4 Then it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by force the thing which he obtained by deceit, that which was delivered to him to keep, the lost thing which he found, 5 Or all that about which he has sworn falsely. He shall even restore it in the principal and shall add to it the fifth part more and give it to him to whom it appertains in the day of his trespass-offering. 6 And he shall bring to the priest his trespass-offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass-offering. 7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD, and he shall be forgiven for anything of all that he has done in trespassing therein."</p>

  <p>8 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 9 "Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the burnt-offering. It is the burnt-offering because of the burning upon the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. 10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment and put his linen breeches on his body. And he shall take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt-offering on the altar and put them beside the altar. 11 And he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry forth the ashes outside the camp to a clean place. 12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it. It shall not be extinguished. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it and burn on it the fat of the peace-offerings. 13 The fire shall continually be burning upon the altar. It shall never go out.</p>

  <p>14 'And this is the law of the food-offering. The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 15 And he shall take from it his handful of the flour of the food-offering and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the food-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, even its memorial, to the LORD. 16 And its remainder Aaron and his sons shall eat. With unleavened bread it shall be eaten in the holy place. In the court of the Tabernacle of the Congregation they shall eat it. 17 It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as is the sin-offering and as the trespass-offering. 18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute forever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire. Everyone who touches them shall be holy.'"</p>

  <p>19 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 20 "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a perpetual food-offering, half of it in the morning and half of it at night. 21 In a pan it shall be made with oil. And when it is baked, you shall bring it in, and the baked pieces of the food-offering you shall offer for a sweet savor to the LORD. 22 And the priest from his sons who is anointed in his stead shall offer it. It is a statute forever to the LORD. It shall be wholly burnt. 23 For every food-offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt. It shall not be eaten."</p>

  <p>24 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 25 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the sin-offering. In the place where the burnt-offering is killed the sin-offering shall be killed before the LORD. It is most holy. 26 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In the holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 27 Whatever touches its flesh shall be holy. And when there is sprinkled some of its blood upon any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in the holy place. 28 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it is boiled in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water. 29 All the males among the priests shall eat of it. It is most holy. 30 And no sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to make reconciliation in the holy place, shall be eaten. It shall be burnt in the fire.'"</p>
