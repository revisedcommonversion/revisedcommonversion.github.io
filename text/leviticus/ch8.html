  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, a bull for the sin-offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread, 3 And assemble all the congregation to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation." 4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly was gathered to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 5 And Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done."</p>

  <p>6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 7 And he put upon him the coat, girded him with the girdle, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him. And he girded him with the skillfully woven girdle of the ephod and bound it to him with it. 8 And he put the breast-plate upon him. He also put in the breast-plate the Urim and the Thummim. 9 And he put the miter upon his head. Also upon the miter, even upon his front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>10 And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it and sanctified them. 11 And he sprinkled part of it upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its vessels, both the basin and its foot, to sanctify them. 12 And he poured some of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him. 13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons and put coats upon them, girded them with girdles, and put caps upon them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>14 And he brought the bull for the sin-offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bull for the sin-offering. 15 And he slew it, and Moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar all around with his finger and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it to make reconciliation upon it. 16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. 17 But the bull and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>18 And he brought the ram for the burnt-offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 19 And Moses killed it and sprinkled the blood all around upon the altar. 20 And Moses cut the ram into pieces and burnt the head, the pieces, and the fat, 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water. And then Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar. It was a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor and an offering made by fire to the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 23 And Moses slew it and took some of its blood and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put some of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around upon the altar. 25 And he took the fat, the rump, all the fat that was upon the inwards, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right shoulder. 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat and upon the right shoulder. 27 And he put all upon Aaron's hands and upon his sons' hands and waved them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 28 And Moses took them from off their hands and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering. They were consecrations for a sweet savor. It is an offering made by fire to the LORD. 29 And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave-offering before the LORD. It was Moses's part of the ram of consecration, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>30 And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was upon the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, his sons, and his sons' garments with him.</p>

  <p>31 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.' 32 And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire. 33 And you shall not go out of the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation for seven days, until the days of your consecration are at an end. For seven days he shall consecrate you. 34 As he has done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do, to make an atonement for you. 35 Therefore, you shall abide at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the LORD so that you do not die, for so I am commanded." 36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>
