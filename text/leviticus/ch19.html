  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel and say to them, 'You shall be holy, for I, the LORD your God, am holy. 3 You shall each fear his mother and his father and keep my sabbaths. I am the LORD your God. 4 Do not turn to idols, nor make for yourselves molten gods. I am the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>5 'And if you offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it at your own will. 6 It shall be eaten the same day you offer it and on the next day. And if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 7 And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable. It shall not be accepted. 8 Therefore, everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD. And that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>

  <p>9 'And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. 10 And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and stranger. I am the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>11 'You shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie to one another. 12 And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>13 'You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him. The wages of him who is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning. 14 You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shall fear your God. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>15 'You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment. You shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in righteousness you shall judge your neighbor. 16 You shall not go up and down as a gossiper among your people, neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>17 'You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall certainly rebuke your neighbor and not bear sin because of him. 18 You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>19 'You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind. You shall not sow your field with mingled seed, neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon you.</p>

  <p>20 'And whoever lies carnally with a woman who is a bond-maid betrothed to a husband and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given to her, she shall be scourged. They shall not be put to death because she was not free. 21 And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, even a ram for a trespass-offering. 22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before the LORD for his sin which he has done. And the sin which he has done shall be forgiven.</p>

  <p>23 'And when you come into the land and have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count its fruit as uncircumcised. Three years it shall be as uncircumcised to you. It shall not be eaten of. 24 But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy to praise the LORD with. 25 And in the fifth year you shall eat of its fruit so that it may yield its increase to you. I am the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>26 'You shall not eat anything with the blood. You shall not use enchantment, nor observe times. 27 You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard. 28 You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>29 'Do not profane your daughter to cause her to be a harlot, lest the land should fall to lewdness and the land become full of wickedness. 30 You shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>31 'Do not regard those who have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards to be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>32 'You shall rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God. I am the LORD.</p>

  <p>33 'And if a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not oppress him. 34 But the stranger who dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>35 'You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity. 36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin you shall have. I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt. 37 Therefore, you shall observe all my statutes and all my judgments and do them. I am the LORD.'"</p>
