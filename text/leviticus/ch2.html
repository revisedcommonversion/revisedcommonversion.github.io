  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "'And when anyone will offer a food-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense upon it. 2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests. And he shall take out of it his handful of its flour and of its oil, with all its frankincense, and the priest shall burn its memorial upon the altar to be an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD. 3 And the remnant of the food-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>

  <p>4 'And if you bring an oblation of a food-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. 5 And if your oblation is a food-offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 6 You shall part it in pieces and pour oil upon it. It is a food-offering. 7 And if your oblation is a food-offering baked in the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 8 And you shall bring the food-offering that is made of these things to the LORD. And when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar. 9 And the priest shall take from the food-offering a memorial of it and shall burn it upon the altar. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD. 10 And that which is left of the food-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>

  <p>11 'No food-offering which you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven. For you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. 12 As for the oblation of the first-fruits, you shall offer them to the LORD, but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor. 13 And every oblation of your food-offering you shall season with salt, neither shall you allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your food-offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.</p>

  <p>14 'And if you offer a food-offering of your first-fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the food-offering of your first-fruits green heads of grain dried by the fire, even grain beaten out of full ears. 15 And you shall put oil upon it and lay frankincense upon it. It is a food-offering. 16 And the priest shall burn its memorial, part of its beaten grain and part of its oil, with all its frankincense. It is an offering made by fire to the LORD.'"</p>
