  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest. 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp and the priest shall look, and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper, 4 Then the priest shall command to take for him who is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, cedar-wood, scarlet, and hyssop. 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water. 6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar-wood, the scarlet, and the hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water. 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field. 8 And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water so that he may be clean. And after that he shall come into the camp and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head, his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair he shall shave off. And he shall wash his clothes and also he shall wash his flesh in water and he shall be clean.</p>

  <p>10 "And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, three tenth-parts of fine flour for a food-offering mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 11 And the priest who makes him clean shall present the man who is to be made clean and those things before the LORD at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 12 And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he kills the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy-place. As the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering. It is most holy. 14 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 15 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. 16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD. 17 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering. 18 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him who is to be cleansed. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. 19 And the priest shall offer the sin-offering and make an atonement for him who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering. 20 And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the food-offering upon the altar. And the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.</p>

  <p>21 "And if he is poor and cannot afford these things, then he shall take one lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved to make an atonement for him, one tenth-part of fine flour mingled with oil for a food-offering, a log of oil, 22 And two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford, and one shall be a sin-offering and the other a burnt-offering. 23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing to the priest to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the LORD. 24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. 25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 26 And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand. 27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD. 28 And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering. 29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him who is to be cleansed to make an atonement for him before the LORD. 30 And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can afford, 31 Even such as he is able to afford, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering, with the food-offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him who is to be cleansed before the LORD. 32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to afford that which pertains to his cleansing."</p>

  <p>33 And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 34 "When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession, 35 And he who owns the house comes and tells the priest, saying, 'It seems to me there is something like a plague in the house,' 36 The priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest enters to see the plague so that all that is in the house may not be made unclean. And afterward the priest shall go in to see the house. 37 And he shall look at the plague, and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall, 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut the house up seven days. 39 And the priest shall come back the seventh day and shall look, and behold, if the plague is spread in the walls of the house, 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city. 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside on all sides, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place. 42 And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.</p>

  <p>43 "And if the plague returns and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones, after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered, 44 Then the priest shall come and look, and behold, if the plague is spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house. It is unclean. 45 And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the mortar of the house, and he shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place. 46 Moreover, he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening. 47 And he who lies in the house shall wash his clothes. And he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.</p>

  <p>48 "And if the priest comes in and looks upon it, and behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the plague is healed. 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, cedar-wood, scarlet, and hyssop. 50 And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water, 51 And he shall take the cedar-wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet. 53 But he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open fields and make an atonement for the house. And it shall be clean."</p>

  <p>54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and itch, 55 And for the leprosy of a garment and of a house, 56 And for a rising, for a scab, and for a bright spot, 57 To teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.</p>
