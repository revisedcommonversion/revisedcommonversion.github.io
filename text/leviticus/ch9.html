  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. 2 And he said to Aaron, "Take a young calf for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. 3 And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, 'Take a kid of the goats for a sin-offering and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering, 4 And also a bull and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a food-offering mingled with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.'" 5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the Tabernacle of the Congregation. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 6 And Moses said, "This is the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do so that the glory of the LORD appears to you." 7 And Moses said to Aaron, "Go to the altar and offer your sin-offering and your burnt-offering and make an atonement for yourself and for the people. And offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them, as the LORD commanded."</p>

  <p>8 Aaron therefore went to the altar and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself. 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar. And he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar. 10 But the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses. 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside the camp.</p>

  <p>12 And he slew the burnt-offering. And Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar. 13 And they presented the burnt-offering to him, with its pieces and the head, and he burnt them upon the altar. 14 And he washed the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.</p>

  <p>15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin-offering for the people, and slew it and offered it for sin, as the first. 16 And he brought the burnt-offering and offered it according to the manner. 17 And he brought the food-offering, took a handful of it, and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning.</p>

  <p>18 He also slew the bull and the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people. And Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar, 19 And the fat of the bull and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers the inwards, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver. 20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar. 21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded.</p>

  <p>22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin-offering, the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings. 23 And Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and came out and blessed the people. And the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. 24 And a fire came out from before the LORD and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat, which when all the people saw, they shouted and fell on their faces.</p>
