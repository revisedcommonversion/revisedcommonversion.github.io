  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2 "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When any man has a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean. 3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh shall run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 4 Every bed on which he lies who has the issue is unclean. And everything on which he sits shall be unclean. 5 And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 6 And he who sits on anything on which he sat who has the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 7 And he who touches the flesh of him who has the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 8 And if he who has the issue spits upon him who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 9 And whatever saddle he rides upon that has the issue shall be unclean. 10 And whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until the evening. And he who bears any of those things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 11 And whomever he touches who has the issue (and has not rinsed his hands in water), he [who was touched] shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 12 And the vessel of earth that he who has the issue touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.</p>

  <p>13 'And when he who has an issue is cleansed of his issue, he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 14 And on the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and give them to the priest. 15 And the priest shall offer them, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.</p>

  <p>16 'And if any man's seed of copulation shall go from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water and be unclean until the evening. 17 And every garment and every skin on which is the seed of copulation shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening. 18 The woman also with whom a man lies with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the evening.</p>

  <p>19 'And if a woman has an issue, and her issue in her flesh is blood, she shall be put apart seven days. And whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening. 20 And everything that she lies upon in her separation shall be unclean. Everything that she sits upon shall also be unclean. 21 And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 22 And whoever touches anything that she sat upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 23 And if it is on her bed or on anything on which she sits when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening. 24 And if any man lies with her at all, and her flowers are upon him, he shall be unclean seven days. And every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.</p>

  <p>25 'And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it runs beyond the time of her separation, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation. She shall be unclean. 26 Every bed on which she lies all the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her separation. And whatever she sits upon shall be unclean as the uncleanness of her separation. 27 And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening. 28 But if she is cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 29 And on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 30 And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.'</p>

  <p>31 "Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness so that they do not die in their uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is among them." 32 This is the law of him who has an issue and of him whose seed goes from him, and he is defiled thereby, 33 And of her who is unwell with her flowers, and of him who has an issue, of the man and of the woman, and of him who lies with her who is unclean.</p>
