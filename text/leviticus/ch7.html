  <p>1 "'Likewise, this is the law of the trespass-offering. It is most holy. 2 In the place where they kill the burnt-offering they shall kill the trespass-offering, and its blood he shall sprinkle around upon the altar. 3 And he shall offer of it all its fat: the rump, the fat that covers the inwards, 4 The two kidneys and the fat that is on them which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys. 5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire to the LORD. It is a trespass-offering. 6 Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in the holy place. It is most holy. 7 As the sin-offering is, so is the trespass-offering. There is one law for them. The priest who makes atonement with it shall have it. 8 And the priest who offers any man's burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he has offered. 9 And all the food-offering that is baked in the oven and all that is dressed in the frying-pan and in the pan shall be the priest's who offers it. 10 And every food-offering mingled with oil, and dry, all the sons of Aaron shall have, one as much as another.</p>

  <p>11 'And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he shall offer to the LORD. 12 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil of fine flour, fried. 13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace-offerings. 14 And from it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for a heave-offering to the LORD, and it shall be the priest's who sprinkles the blood of the peace-offerings.</p>

  <p>15 'And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until the morning. 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day also its remainder shall be eaten. 17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it. It shall be an abomination. And the soul who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>

  <p>19 'And the flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, all who are clean shall eat of it. 20 But the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 21 Moreover, the soul who touches any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings which pertain to the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"</p>

  <p>22 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 23 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'You shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, of sheep, or of goat. 24 And the fat of the beast that dies of itself and the fat of that which is torn by beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you shall in no way eat of it. 25 For whoever eats the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people. 26 Moreover, you shall eat no manner of blood, whether of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 27 Whatever soul it may be who eats any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"</p>

  <p>28 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 29 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'He who offers the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to the LORD shall bring his oblation to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings. 30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire. The fat with the breast, those he shall bring so that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before the LORD. 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 32 And the right shoulder you shall give to the priest for a heave-offering of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings. 33 He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace-offerings and the fat shall have the right shoulder for his part. 34 For the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder I have taken from the children of Israel, from off the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons by a statute forever from among the children of Israel.</p>

  <p>35 'This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office, 36 Which the LORD commanded to be given to them by the children of Israel in the day that he anointed them by a statute forever throughout their generations.'"</p>

  <p>37 This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the food-offering, of the sin-offering, of the trespass-offering, of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, 38 Which the LORD commanded Moses on mount Sinai in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations to the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
