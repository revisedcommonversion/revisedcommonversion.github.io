  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "'And if his oblation is a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he offers it from the herd, whether a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. And Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood all around upon the altar. 3 And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace-offering an offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the inwards, all the fat that is upon the inwards, 4 The two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys. 5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar, upon the burnt-sacrifice which is upon the wood that is on the fire. It is an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD.</p>
  
  <p>6 'And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace-offering to the LORD is of the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 7 If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before the LORD. 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation. And Aaron's sons shall sprinkle its blood around upon the altar. 9 And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace-offering an offering made by fire to the LORD: its fat, the whole rump which he shall take off close to the back-bone, the fat that covers the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 10 The two kidneys and the fat that is upon them which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys. 11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar. It is the food of the offering made by fire to the LORD.</p>

  <p>12 'And if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD. 13 And he shall lay his hand upon its head and kill it before the Tabernacle of the Congregation. And the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around upon the altar. 14 And he shall offer from it his offering, even an offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the inwards and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 15 The two kidneys and the fat that is upon them which is by the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys. 16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar. It is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savor. All the fat is the LORD'S. 17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings that you eat neither fat nor blood.'"</p>
