  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel and say to them, 'This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, saying, 3 "Whatever man there may be of the house of Israel who kills an ox, lamb, or goat in the camp, or who kills it out of the camp, 4 And does not bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood, and that man shall be cut off from among his people. 5 This is so that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even so that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to the priest, and offer them for peace-offerings to the LORD. 6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation and burn the fat for a sweet savor to the LORD. 7 And they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to idols, with which they have committed idolatry. This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations."'</p>

  <p>8 "And you shall say to them, 'Whatever man there may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, who offers a burnt-offering or sacrifice, 9 And does not bring it to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer it to the LORD, even that man shall be cut off from among his people.</p>

  <p>10 'And whatever man there may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eats any manner of blood, I will even set my face against that soul who eats blood and will cut him off from among his people. 11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul.' 12 Therefore, I said to the children of Israel, 'No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.' 13 And whatever man there may be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and catches any beast or bird that may be eaten, he shall even pour out its blood and cover it with dust.</p>

  <p>14 "For it is the life of all flesh, its blood is for its life; therefore, I said to the children of Israel, 'You shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood.' Whoever eats it shall be cut off. 15 And every soul who eats that which died of itself or that which was torn by beasts (whether it is someone of your own country, or a stranger), he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening. Then he shall be clean. 16 But if he does not wash them, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity."</p>
