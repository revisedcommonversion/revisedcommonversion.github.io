  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "'And if a soul sins and hears the voice of swearing and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it, if he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity. 2 Or if a soul touches any unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean beast, a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping animals, and it is hidden from him, he also shall be unclean and guilty. 3 Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness it may be that a man shall be defiled with, and it is hid from him, when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty. 4 Or if a soul swears, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it may be that a man pronounces with an oath, and it is hid from him, when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these. 5 And it shall be, when he is guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he has sinned in that thing, 6 And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering. And the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.</p>

  <p>7 'And if he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass which he has committed two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the LORD, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering. 8 And he shall bring them to the priest who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it apart. 9 And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar. It is a sin-offering. 10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.</p>

  <p>11 'But if he is not able to bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering. He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin-offering. 12 Then he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD. It is a sin-offering. 13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned in one of these, and he shall be forgiven. And the remnant shall be the priest's as a food-offering.'"</p>

  <p>14 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 15 "If a soul commits a trespass and sins through ignorance in the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with your estimation by shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering. 16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he has done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.</p>

  <p>17 "And if a soul sins and commits any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD, though he did not know it, yet he is guilty, he shall bear his iniquity. 18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass-offering to the priest. And the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and did not know it, and he shall be forgiven. 19 It is a trespass-offering. He has certainly trespassed against the LORD."</p>
