  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation. 3 And your estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary. 4 And if it is a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels. 5 And if it is from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 6 And if it is from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver. 7 And if it is from sixty years old and above, if a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 8 But if he is poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him. According to the ability of him who vowed the priest shall value him.</p>

  <p>9 'And if it is a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD shall be holy. 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad or a bad for a good. And if he at all changes beast for beast, then it and its exchange shall be holy. 11 And if it is any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest, 12 And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad. As you value it, who are the priest, so it shall be. 13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part of it to your estimation.</p>

  <p>14 'And when a man sanctifies his house to be holy to the LORD, the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest estimates it, so it shall stand. 15 And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it and it shall be his.</p>

  <p>16 'And if a man sanctifies to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to its seed. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 17 If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand. 18 But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from your estimation. 19 And if he who sanctified the field will in any way redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it and it shall be assured to him. 20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. 21 But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD as a field devoted. Its possession shall be the priest's. 22 And if a man sanctifies to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, 23 Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubilee, and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD. 24 In the year of the jubilee, the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belonged. 25 And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary. Twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</p>

  <p>26 'Only the first-born of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S first-born, no man shall sanctify it, whether ox or sheep. It is the LORD'S. 27 And if it is of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it, according to your estimation, and shall add to it a fifth part of it. Or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</p>

  <p>28 'But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD. 29 No one devoted who is devoted by men shall be redeemed, but shall surely be put to death.</p>

  <p>30 'And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S. It is holy to the LORD. 31 And if a man will at all redeem anything of his tithes, he shall add to it its fifth part. 32 And concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD. 33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it. And if he changes it at all, then both it and its change shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.'"</p>

  <p>34 These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel on mount Sinai.</p>
