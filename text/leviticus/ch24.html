  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light to cause the lamps to burn continually. 3 Outside the veil of the testimony, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, Aaron shall order it from the evening to the morning before the LORD continually. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. 4 You shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.</p>

  <p>5 "And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Two tenth-parts shall be in one cake. 6 And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 7 And you shall put pure frankincense upon each row so that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD. 8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons', and they shall eat it in the holy place, for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute."</p>

  <p>10 And the son of an Israelitish woman whose father was an Egyptian went out among the children of Israel, and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. 11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD and cursed. And they brought him to Moses (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan), 12 And they put him in custody so that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them.</p>

  <p>13 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 14 "Bring forth him who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 15 And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. 16 And he who blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him. The stranger, as well as he who is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.</p>

  <p>17 'And he who kills any man shall surely be put to death. 18 And he who kills a beast shall make it good, beast for beast. 19 And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbor, as he has done, so it shall be done to him, 20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has caused a blemish in a man, so it shall be done to him. 21 And he who kills a beast, he shall restore it. And he who kills a man, he shall be put to death. 22 You shall have one manner of law for the stranger as well as for one of your own country. For I am the LORD your God.'"</p>

  <p>23 And Moses spoke to the children of Israel that they should bring forth him who had cursed out of the camp and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
