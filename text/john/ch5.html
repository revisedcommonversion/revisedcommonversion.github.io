    <p class="ch-outline">Jesus on the sabbath day cures him who was diseased thirty-eight years, 1-9. The Jews therefore make a trivial objection and persecute Jesus for it, 10-16.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After this, there was a feast of the Jews. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>2 Now there is a pool in Jerusalem by the sheep market, which is called in the Hebrew language, Bethesda, having five porches. 3 In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and agitated the water. Then whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was cured of whatever disease he had. 5 And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. 6 When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he says to him, "<span class="woc">Do you wish to be healed?</span>" 7 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is agitated. But while I am coming, another steps down before me." 8 Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">Rise, take up your bed, and walk.</span>" 9 And immediately the man was healed and he took up his bed and walked. Now on the same day was the sabbath. 10 The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, "It is the sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry your bed." 11 He answered them, "He who healed me, the same said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.'" 12 Then they asked him, "What man is this who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?" 13 And he who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 14 Afterward, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, "<span class="woc">Behold, you are cured. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.</span>" 15 The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. 16 And therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath. 17 But Jesus answered them, "<span class="woc">My Father works until now, and I also work.</span>"</p>

  <p>18 Therefore, the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>

  <p>19 Then Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing by himself, but what he sees the Father do. For whatever things he does, these also the Son does likewise.</span> 20 <span class="woc">For the Father loves the Son and shows him all things that he himself does. And he will show him greater works than these so that you may marvel.</span> 21 <span class="woc">For as the Father raises the dead and revives them, even so the Son revives whom he wishes.</span> 22 <span class="woc">For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son,</span> 23 <span class="woc">So that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent him.</span></p>

  <p>24 "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes in him who sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but has passed from death to life.</span></p>

  <p>25 "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and is now, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And those who hear shall live.</span> 26 <span class="woc">For as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself,</span> 27 <span class="woc">And has given him authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.</span> 28 <span class="woc">Do not marvel at this. For the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice,</span> 29 <span class="woc">And shall come forth—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</span></p>

  <p>30 "<span class="woc">I can of my own self do nothing. As I hear, I judge. And my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.</span></p>

  <p>31 "<span class="woc">If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.</span> 32 <span class="woc">There is another who testifies concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he bears concerning me is true.</span></p>

  <p>33 "<span class="woc">You sent to John and he testified to the truth.</span> 34 <span class="woc">But I do not receive testimony from man. But these things I say so that you may be saved.</span> 35 <span class="woc">He was a burning and a shining light, and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</span></p>

  <p>36 "<span class="woc">But I have greater testimony than that of John. For the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.</span></p>

  <p>37 "<span class="woc">And the Father himself who has sent me has borne testimony concerning me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</span> 38 <span class="woc">And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</span></p>

  <p>39 "<span class="woc">You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are those which testify of me.</span> 40 <span class="woc">And you will not come to me so that you may have life.</span> 41 <span class="woc">I do not receive honor from men.</span> 42 <span class="woc">But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</span> 43 <span class="woc">I have come in my Father's name and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.</span> 44 <span class="woc">How can you believe, who receive honor from one another and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?</span> 45 <span class="woc">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.</span> 46 <span class="woc">For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he wrote concerning me.</span> 47 <span class="woc">But if you do not believe his writings, how shall you believe my words?</span>"</p>
