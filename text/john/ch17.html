  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Jesus spoke these words and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, "<span class="woc">Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that your Son also may glorify you,</span> 2 <span class="woc">As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.</span> 4 <span class="woc">I have glorified you on the earth. I have finished the work which you gave me to do.</span> 5 <span class="woc">And now, O Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.</span></p>

  <p>6 "<span class="woc">I have manifested your name to the men whom you gave to me out of the world. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</span> 7 <span class="woc">Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you.</span> 8 <span class="woc">For I have given to them the words which you gave me, and they have received them and have known surely that I came from you. And they have believed that you sent me.</span> 9 <span class="woc">I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given to me, for they are yours.</span> 10 <span class="woc">And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you. Holy Father, keep, through your own name, those whom you have given to me so that they may be one, as we are.</span> 12 <span class="woc">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you gave to me I have kept, and not one of them is lost but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span></p>

  <p>13 "<span class="woc">And now I come to you, and these things I speak in the world so that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span> 14 <span class="woc">I have given to them your word. And the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> 15 <span class="woc">I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.</span> 16 <span class="woc">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> 17 <span class="woc">Sanctify them through your truth. Your word is truth.</span> 18 <span class="woc">As you have sent me into the world, even so I have also sent them into the world.</span> 19 <span class="woc">And for their sakes I sanctify myself so that they also may be sanctified through the truth.</span></p>

  <p>20 "<span class="woc">I do not pray for these alone, but for those also who shall believe in me through their word,</span> 21 <span class="woc">So that they all may be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, and that they also may be one in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.</span></p>

  <p>22 "<span class="woc">And the glory which you gave to me I have given to them so that they may be one, even as we are one.</span> 23 <span class="woc">I am in them and you are in me so that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that you have sent me and have loved them as you have loved me.</span> 24 <span class="woc">Father, I wish that they also whom you have given to me be with me where I am so that they may behold my glory which you have given to me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span></p>

  <p>25 "<span class="woc">O righteous Father, the world has not known you. But I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And I have declared to them your name, and will declare it, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.</span>"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YDBKC0ejsRdg1Obqi43y-Bq9xy-4bBABwZbtQir_9Fk/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - John, Chapter 17</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1] - "the hour has come" - In other words, "the time has come."</p>
  <p>[v.2] - Reference, John 6:35-40, 10:28.</p>
  <p>[v.5a] - "before the world was" - In other words, "before the world existed."</p>
  <p>[v.5b] - Reference, Proverbs 8:23, and even Proverbs 8:22-36. See also John 1:1-4.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "the Scripture" - From John Gill's Exposition: "This respects either Christ's keeping of his people, and their final perseverance, whereby the Scriptures that speak of it are fulfilled; or rather the destruction of Judas, whereby such passages as speak of that, have their accomplishment, particularly Psalm 109:8; Some have thought that this only refers to the general sense of the Scriptures, both the law and prophets; that some are chosen to everlasting life, and others are appointed to wrath; that some are saved, and others lost; some sons of God, and others sons of perdition; but it rather seems to regard some particular passage or passages of Scripture relating to Judas, his character, condition and end, and which are very manifestly pointed at, in the psalm referred to."</p>
