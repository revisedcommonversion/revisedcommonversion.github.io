  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him, and without him nothing was made that was made. 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.</p>

  <p>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 The same came for a witness to bear testimony of the Light so that all men through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear testimony of that Light.</p>

  <p>9 That was the true Light, which lights every man who comes into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own, and his own did not receive him. 12 But as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God, even to those who believe in his name, 13 Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

  <p>14 And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth. 15 John testified concerning him, and cried, saying, "This was he of whom I spoke, 'He who comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.'" 16 And of his fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18 No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.</p>

  <p>19 And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 20 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." 21 And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" And he says, "I am not." "Are you that prophet?" And he answered, "No." 22 Then they said to him, "Who are you? For we must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say of yourself?" 23 He said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"I am <cite>'the voice of one crying in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Make straight the way of the Lord,"</cite>'</p>
  </div>

  <p>as the prophet Isaiah said."</p>

  <p>24 And those who were sent were of the Pharisees. 25 And they asked him, and said to him, "Why do you baptize then, if you are not that Christ, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?" 26 John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands one among you whom you do not know. 27 It is he, who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes' latchet I am not worthy to unloose." 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing.</p>

  <p>29 The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. 30 This is he of whom I said, 'After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.' 31 And I did not know him. But so that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore I have come baptizing with water." 32 And John bore testimony, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed upon him. 33 And I did not know him. But he who sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' 34 And I saw and bore testimony that this is the Son of God."</p>

  <p>35 Again the next day, John stood, along with two of his disciples, 36 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he says, "Behold the Lamb of God!" 37 And the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and says to them, "<span class="woc">What do you seek?</span>" They said to him, "Rabbi"—which is to say, being interpreted, Master—"where do you dwell?" 39 He says to them, "<span class="woc">Come and see.</span>" They came and saw where he dwelt and stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour. 40 One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, "We have found the Messiah," (which is, being interpreted, the Christ). 42 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, "<span class="woc">You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas,</span>" (which is, by interpretation, a stone).</p>

  <p>43 The day following, Jesus wished to go forth into Galilee and finds Philip, and says to him, "<span class="woc">Follow me.</span>" 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, "We have found him described by Moses in the law and by the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph." 46 And Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip says to him, "Come and see." 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, "<span class="woc">Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile!</span>" 48 Nathanael says to him, "Where do you know me from?" Jesus answered and said to him, "<span class="woc">Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig-tree, I saw you.</span>" 49 Nathanael answered and said to him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel." 50 Jesus answered and said to him, "<span class="woc">Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig-tree,' do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.</span>" 51 And he says to him, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open '<cite>and the angels of God ascending and descending</cite>' upon the Son of man.</span>"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/john/MHC%20-%20John%2C%20Chapter%2001.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - John, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.5] - "overcome" - This was originally, "comprehend." The ASV reads, "apprehend." This word has the sense of "laying hold with evil intent," or, overtaking (John 12:35; 1st Thessalonians 5:4; Mark 9:18), suppressing, overcoming (Pulpit Commentary).</p>
  <p>[v.17] - "Jesus Christ" - See the note for Matthew 1:1.</p>
  <p>[v.21a] - "Are you Elijah?" - Reference, Malachi 4:5.</p>
  <p>[v.21b] - "Are you that prophet?" - This question asked is in reference to Deuteronomy 18:15. John the Baptist denies that he is that prophet, for he knows that Christ is soon to come, as he says in verses 23, 26 and 27.</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Quoting Isaiah 40:3 (paraphrased). </p>
  <p>[v.26-27] - Gospel Link: Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:7-8; Luke 3:16.</p>
  <p>[v.32] - Gospel Link: Matthew 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22.</p>
  <p>[v.33] - Reference, Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16.</p>
  <p>[v.38] - The words of Jesus Christ appear in this blue color throughout the New Testament.</p>
  <p>[v.51] - Quoting Genesis 28:12.</p>
