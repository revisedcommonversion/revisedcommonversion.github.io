  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After these things, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and in this manner he showed himself:</p>

  <p>2 Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter says to them, "I am going fishing." They say to him, "We also will go with you." They went forth and entered into a boat immediately. And that night they caught nothing.</p>

  <p>4 But when the morning had already come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">Children, do you have any victuals?</span>" They answered him, "No." 6 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you shall find.</span>" They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish. 7 Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, "It is the Lord." Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt on his fisher's coat (for he was unclad) and cast himself into the sea. 8 And the other disciples came in a little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fish.</p>

  <p>9 Then as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there with fish laid upon them and also bread. 10 Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.</span>" 11 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fish—one hundred and fifty-three. And even though there were so many, yet the net was not broken.</p>

  <p>12 Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">Come and dine.</span>" And none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and likewise the fish. 14 This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.</p>

  <p>15 So when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, "<span class="woc">Simon son of Jonah, do you love me more than these?</span>" He says to him, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you." He says to him, "<span class="woc">Feed my lambs.</span>" 16 He says to him again the second time, "<span class="woc">Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?</span>" He says to him, "Yes, Lord. You know that I love you." He says to him, "<span class="woc">Feed my sheep.</span>" 17 He says to him the third time, "<span class="woc">Simon son of Jonah, do you love me?</span>" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know all things. You know that I love you." Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">Feed my sheep.</span> 18 <span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girt yourself and walked where you wished, but when you are old, you shall stretch forth your hands and another shall gird you and carry you where you do not wish.</span>" 19 He spoke this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he says to him, "<span class="woc">Follow me.</span>"</p>

  <p>20 Then Peter, turning around, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following (who also leaned on his chest at supper and said, "Lord, who is he who betrays you?"). 21 Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, "Lord, and what shall this man do?" 22 Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">If I wish that he tarries until I come, what is that to you? Follow me.</span>" 23 Then this saying went abroad among the brothers, that this disciple should not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he shall not die, but, "If I wish that he tarries until I come, what is that to you?"</p>

  <p>24 This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things. And we know that his testimony is true.</p>

  <p>25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should all be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</p>
