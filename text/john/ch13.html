    <p class="ch-outline">Jesus washes the disciples' feet and exhorts them to humility and charity, 1-17. He foretells and reveals to John by a token that Judas should betray him, 18-30; commands them to love one another, 31-35; and forewarns Peter of his denial, 36-38.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. 2 And during supper (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him), 3 Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God, 4 Rises from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel, and girded himself.</p>

  <p>5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. 6 Then he comes to Simon Peter, and Peter says to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?" 7 Jesus answered and said to him, "<span class="woc">What I do you do not now know, but you shall know hereafter.</span>" 8 Peter says to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "<span class="woc">If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.</span>" 9 Simon Peter says to him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." 10 Jesus says to him, "<span class="woc">He who is washed has no need except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all.</span>" 11 For he knew who would betray him; therefore, he said, "You are not all clean."</p>

  <p>12 So after he had washed their feet, had taken his garments, and had sat down again, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Do you know what I have done to you?</span> 13 <span class="woc">You call me Master and Lord, and you speak rightly, for I am so.</span> 14 <span class="woc">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> 15 <span class="woc">For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you.</span> 16 <span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, the servant is not greater than his lord, neither he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</span> 17 <span class="woc">If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.</span> 18 <span class="woc">I do not speak of you all. I know whom I have chosen, but this is so that the Scripture may be fulfilled, '<cite>He who eats bread with me, has lifted up his heel against me.</cite>'</span> 19 <span class="woc">Now I tell you before it comes, so that when it has come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</span> 20 <span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span>"</p>

  <p>21 When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit and testified, and said, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</span>" 22 Then the disciples looked at one another, doubting of whom he spoke. 23 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him to ask who it should be of whom he spoke. 25 Then lying on Jesus' chest, he says to him, "Lord, who is it?" 26 Jesus answered, "<span class="woc">It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.</span>" And when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 27 And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">What you do, do quickly.</span>" 28 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him. 29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the money-box, that Jesus had told him to buy those things that they had need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor. 30 Then having received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</p>

  <p>31 Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus said, "<span class="woc">Now the Son of man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> 32 <span class="woc">If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately.</span> 33 <span class="woc">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I go, you cannot come,' so now I say to you.</span> 34 <span class="woc">A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. As I have loved you, you also should love one another.</span> 35 <span class="woc">By this all men shall know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.</span>"</p>

  <p>36 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, where do you go?" Jesus answered him, "<span class="woc">Where I go, you cannot follow me now, but you shall follow me afterward.</span>" 37 Peter said to him, "Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake." 38 Jesus answered him, "<span class="woc">Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow until you have denied me three times.</span>"</p>
