  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And on the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 And both Jesus and his disciples were called to the marriage. 3 And when they lacked wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, "They have no wine." 4 Jesus says to her, "<span class="woc">Woman, what does that have to do with me and you? My hour has not yet come.</span>" 5 His mother says to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it." 6 And six water-pots of stone were set there, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three measures apiece. 7 Jesus says to them, "<span class="woc">Fill the water-pots with water.</span>" And they filled them to the brim. 8 And he says to them, "<span class="woc">Draw out now and take it to the master of the feast.</span>" And they took it. 9 When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and did not know where it was from (but the servants who drew the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom, 10 And says to him, "Every man at the beginning presents good wine, and when men have well drank, then that which is worse. But you have kept the good wine until now." 11 This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</p>

  <p>12 After this he went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they continued there not many days.</p>

  <p>13 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 14 And found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overthrew the tables, 16 And said to those who sold doves, "<span class="woc">Take these things from here. Do not make my Father's house a house of merchandise.</span>" 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, "<cite>The zeal of your house has eaten me up.</cite>" 18 Then the Jews answered, and said to him, "What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?" 19 Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</span>" 20 Then the Jews said, "Forty-six years this temple was in building, and will you rear it up in three days?" 21 But he spoke of the temple of his body. 22 When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them. And they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p>

  <p>23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, on the feast day, many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he performed. 24 But Jesus did not commit himself to them, for he knew all men, 25 And did not need that any should testify concerning man, for he knew what was in man.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/john/MHC%20-%20John%2C%20Chapter%2002.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - John, Chapter 2</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.6] - "measures" - This was originally rendered as, "firkins," but is probably more proper as, "measures," from the Greek word, metretes. According to the 1913 Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, a firkin is equal to 9 imperial gallons, or 10.8 US gallons (1 imperial gallon = 1.2 US gallons). According to this measure, the jars held between 21.6 and 32.4 US gallons. The size of this measure varies from source to source, but most agree that the measures were estimated between 8 and 10 gallons. John Gill, in his Exposition of the Bible, notes that the measure is uncertain and that, "it is most likely it answered to the 'Hebrew bath,' which was a common measure of liquids with the Jews, and held four gallons and a half, or more... so that such of these vessels, that held two of these measures, contained nine gallons, and such as held three of them, thirteen gallons and a half; and six of these contained a large quantity of wine, one with another: and which makes the following miracle the greater; and shows the liberality of Christ the more, in providing for the following days of the feast, for a marriage was kept seven days; and for the family, some time after it was over."</p>
  <p>[v.13-16] - Gospel Link: Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45-46.</p>
  <p>[v.17] - Quoting Psalm 69:9 (LXX).</p>
