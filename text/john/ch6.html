    <p class="ch-outline">Christ feeds five thousand men with five loaves and two fish, 1-14. Thereupon the people would have made him king, 15; but withdrawing himself, he walks on the sea to his disciples, 16-25; reproves the people flocking after him and all the fleshly hearers of his word, 26-31; declares himself to be the bread of life to believers, 32-65.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After these things, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he performed on those who were diseased. 3 And Jesus went upon a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. 5 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come to him, he says to Philip, "<span class="woc">Where shall we buy bread so that these may eat?</span>" 6 (And he said this to prove him, for he himself knew what he would do.) 7 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, so that each of them may receive a little." 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him, 9 "There is a boy here who has five barley-loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?" 10 And Jesus said, "<span class="woc">Make the men sit down.</span>" (Now there was much grass in the place.) So the men sat down in number about five thousand. 11 And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, and likewise of the fish, as much as they wished. 12 When they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, "<span class="woc">Gather the fragments that remain so that nothing may be lost.</span>" 13 Therefore, they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley-loaves which remained over and above by those who had eaten. 14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed, said, "This is truly that prophet who should come into the world."</p>

  <p>15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again to a mountain by himself alone.</p>

  <p>16 And when evening had now come, his disciples went down to the sea, 17 Entered into a boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. It was now dark and Jesus had not come to them. 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 19 So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat, and they were afraid. 20 But he says to them, "<span class="woc">It is I. Do not be afraid.</span>" 21 Then they willingly received him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</p>

  <p>22 The day following, when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus did not go with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone 23 (Yet there came other boats from Tiberias near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks), 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus. 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</p>

  <p>26 Jesus answered them and said, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the miracles, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied.</span> 27 <span class="woc">Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for that food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man will give to you, for God the Father has sealed him.</span>" 28 Then they said to him, "What shall we do so that we may work the works of God?" 29 Jesus answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">This is the work of God: that you believe in him whom he has sent.</span>" 30 They said therefore to him, "What sign do you show then so that we may see and believe you? What do you work? 31 Our fathers ate manna in the desert. As it is written, '<cite>He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</cite>'" 32 Then Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you that bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> 33 <span class="woc">For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.</span>" 34 Then they said to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."</p>

  <p>35 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</span> 36 <span class="woc">But I said to you, that you also have seen me and do not believe.</span> 37 <span class="woc">All whom the Father gives me shall come to me, and he who comes to me, I will in no way reject.</span> 38 <span class="woc">For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> 39 <span class="woc">And this is the Father's will who has sent me: that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</span> 40 <span class="woc">And this is the will of him who sent me: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have everlasting life. And I will raise him up at the last day.</span>"</p>

  <p>41 The Jews then murmured at him because he said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven." 42 And they said, "Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he says, 'I came down from heaven'?" 43 Jesus therefore answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">Do not murmur among yourselves.</span> 44 <span class="woc">No man can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him. And I will raise him up at the last day.</span> 45 <span class="woc">It is written in the prophets, '<cite>And they shall be all taught from God.</cite>' Every man therefore who has heard and has learned from the Father comes to me.</span> 46 <span class="woc">Not that any man has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.</span> 47 <span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me has everlasting life.</span> 48 <span class="woc">I am that bread of life.</span> 49 <span class="woc">Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead.</span> 50 <span class="woc">This is the bread which comes down from heaven so that a man may eat of it and not die.</span> 51 <span class="woc">I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eats of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</span>"</p>

  <p>52 The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 53 Then Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span> 54 <span class="woc">Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life. And I will raise him up at the last day.</span> 55 <span class="woc">For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> 56 <span class="woc">He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me, and I in him.</span> 57 <span class="woc">As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he who eats me, even he shall live by me.</span> 58 <span class="woc">This is that bread which came down from heaven—not as your fathers ate manna and are dead. He who eats of this bread shall live forever.</span>"</p>

  <p>59 He said these things in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</p>

  <p>60 Therefore, when they had heard this, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard saying. Who can hear it?" 61 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Does this offend you?</span> 62 <span class="woc">What if you see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</span> 63 <span class="woc">It is the Spirit that revives. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life.</span> 64 <span class="woc">But there are some of you who do not believe.</span>" For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe and who he was who would betray him. 65 And he said, "<span class="woc">Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me unless it were given to him by my Father.</span>"</p>

  <p>66 From that time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him. 67 Then Jesus said to the twelve, "<span class="woc">Will you also go away?</span>" 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God." 70 Jesus answered them, "<span class="woc">Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span>" 71 He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon. For it was he who was to betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1-13] - Gospel Link: Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17.</p>
  <p>[v.14] - "This is truly that prophet who should come into the world" - This is, of course, spoken of Christ. His disciples are referring to the passage in Deuteronomy 18:15, which is, "The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the midst of you..." See also the comments for John 1:21 and Deuteronomy 18:15.</p>
  <p>[v.15-20] - Gospel Link: Matthew 14:22-27; Mark 6:45-50.</p>
  <p>[v.31-33] - Reference, Exodus 16:4, 15, 32; Deuteronomy 8:3.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - Quoting Psalm 78:24.</p>
  <p>[v.40] - Reference, John 10:28, 17:2.</p>
  <p>[v.44] - Reference, James 4:8.</p>
  <p>[v.45] - Quoting Isaiah 54:13.</p>
  <p>[v.69] - "you are that Christ" - In other words, "you are the Messiah."</p>
  <p>[v.71] - "son of Simon" - That is, the son of Simon Iscariot, not Simon as in Peter (Matthew 10:2; John 1:42; Acts 10:5). Peter's last name is Barjona (Matthew 16:17).</p>
