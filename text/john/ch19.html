    <p class="ch-outline">Christ is scourged, crowned with thorns, and beaten, 1-3.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him. 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him, 3 And said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they smote him with their hands. 4 Pilate therefore went forth again, and says to them, "Behold, I bring him forth to you so that you may know that I find no fault in him." 5 Then Jesus came forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate says to them, "Behold the man!" 6 Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify him. Crucify him." Pilate says to them, "Take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him." 7 The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God."</p>

  <p>8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid, 9 And went again into the judgment-hall and says to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. 10 Then Pilate says to him, "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you and power to release you?" 11 Jesus answered, "<span class="woc">You could have no power against me unless it were given to you from above. Therefore, he who delivered me to you has the greater sin.</span>" 12 And from thereafter, Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king, speaks against Caesar."</p>

  <p>13 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth and sat down on the judgment-seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14 And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, "Behold your King!" 15 But they cried out, "Away with him. Away with him. Crucify him." Pilate says to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</p>

  <p>16 So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.</p>

  <p>17 And he, bearing his cross, went forth into a place called The Place of a Skull (which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha). 18 There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on each side and Jesus in the midst. 19 And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was, "JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS." 20 Many of the Jews then read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am King of the Jews."'" 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</p>

  <p>23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 24 Therefore, they said among themselves, "Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it shall be," so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>They parted my clothing among them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for my vesture they cast lots.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>Therefore the soldiers did these things. 25 Now standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he says to his mother, "<span class="woc">Woman, behold your son!</span>" 27 Then he says to the disciple, "<span class="woc">Behold your mother!</span>" And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.</p>

  <p>28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, says, "<span class="woc">I thirst.</span>" 29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar. And they filled a sponge with vinegar, put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "<span class="woc">It is finished,</span>" and he bowed his head and expired.</p>

  <p>31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, so that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day), implored Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. 32 Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him. 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35 And he who saw it, testified—and his testimony is true, and he knows that he speaks truth—so that you may believe. 36 For these things were done so that the Scripture should be fulfilled: "<cite>A bone of him shall not be broken.</cite>" 37 And again another Scripture says, "<cite>They shall look at him whom they pierced.</cite>"</p>

  <p>38 And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) petitioned Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him leave. He therefore came and took the body of Jesus. 39 And Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) also came and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds in weight. 40 Then they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews for burial. 41 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulcher in which no man had ever yet laid. 42 Therefore, because of the Jews' preparation-day and because the sepulcher was near at hand, they laid Jesus there.</p>
