  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 "<span class="woc">These things I have spoken to you so that you should not be offended.</span> 2 <span class="woc">They shall put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span> 4 <span class="woc">But these things I have told you so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I did not say to you at the beginning because I was with you.</span></p>

  <p>5 "<span class="woc">But now I go to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where do you go?'</span> 6 <span class="woc">But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> 7 <span class="woc">Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I depart. For if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send him to you.</span> 8 <span class="woc">And when he has come, he will reprove the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> 9 <span class="woc">Of sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> 10 <span class="woc">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father and you will no longer see me;</span> 11 <span class="woc">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span></p>

  <p>12 "<span class="woc">I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> 13 <span class="woc">But when the Spirit of truth has come, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, that he will speak. And he will declare to you the things that are to come.</span> 14 <span class="woc">He will glorify me, for he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you.</span> 15 <span class="woc">All things that the Father has are mine; therefore, I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span></p>

  <p>16 "<span class="woc">A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me because I go to the Father.</span>" 17 Then some of his disciples said among themselves, "What is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me,' and, 'Because I go to the Father'?" 18 They said therefore, "What is this that he says, 'A little while'? We cannot tell what he says." 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said to them, "<span class="woc">Do you inquire among yourselves of that which I said, 'A little while, and you shall not see me. And again a little while, and you shall see me'?</span> 20 <span class="woc">Truly, truly, I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. And you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> 21 <span class="woc">A woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour has come. But as soon as she delivers the child, she no longer remembers the anguish because of her joy that a man is born into the world.</span> 22 <span class="woc">Now, therefore, you also have sorrow. But I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no man takes your joy from you.</span></p>

  <p>23 "<span class="woc">And in that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span> 24 <span class="woc">Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you shall receive so that your joy may be full.</span></p>

  <p>25 "<span class="woc">These things I have spoken to you in proverbs, but the time comes when I shall no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father.</span> 26 <span class="woc">At that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,</span> 27 <span class="woc">For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span> 28 <span class="woc">I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.</span>"</p>

  <p>29 His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you speak plainly and speak no proverb. 30 Now we are sure that you know all things and do not need that any man should ask you. By this we believe that you came from God." 31 Jesus answered them, "<span class="woc">Do you now believe?</span> 32 <span class="woc">Behold, the hour comes and has even now come, that you shall each be scattered to his own and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.</span> 33 <span class="woc">These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world.</span>"</p>
