  <p>1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah. 2 And they had in their inheritance, Beer-sheba (or Sheba), Moladah, 3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Azem, 4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sheruhen; thirteen cities and their villages; 7 Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages; 8 And all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath-beer (Ramath of the south). This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. 9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them; therefore, the children of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.</p>

  <p>10 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families. And the border of their inheritance was to Sarid. 11 And their border went up toward the sea and Maralah, reached to Dabbasheth, reached to the river that is before Jokneam, 12 Turned from Sarid eastward, toward the sunrise, to the border of Chisloth-tabor, then goes out to Daberath, then goes up to Japhia; 13 From there passes along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goes out to Remmon-methoar to Neah; 14 And the border compasses it on the north side to Hannathon; and its limits are in the valley of Jiphthah-el; 15 And Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Beth-lehem; twelve cities with their villages. 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.</p>

  <p>17 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families. 18 And their border was toward Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 19 Hapharaim, Shihon, Anaharath, 20 Rabbith, Kishion, Abez, 21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez; 22 And the border reaches to Tabor, Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh, and the limits of their border were at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages. 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.</p>

  <p>24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families. 25 And their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 26 Alammelech, Amad, and Misheal, and reaches to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath, 27 And turns toward the sunrise to Beth-dagon, and reaches to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goes out to Cabul on the left hand, 28 And Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon; 29 And then the border turns to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre, and the border turns to Hosah; and its limits are at the sea from the coast to Achzib; 30 Also Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages. 31 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.</p>

  <p>32 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families. 33 And their border was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the limits thereof were at the Jordan; 34 And then the border turns westward to Aznoth-tabor, goes out from there to Hukkok, reaches to Zebulun on the south side, reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon the Jordan toward the sunrise; 35 And the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 38 Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.</p>

  <p>40 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families. 41 And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 42 Shaalabbim, Ajalon, Jethlah, 43 Elon, Thimnathah, Ekron, 44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 46 Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho. 47 And the border of the children of Dan, went out too little for them; therefore, the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, took it, smote it with the edge of the sword, possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</p>

  <p>49 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them. 50 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the mountains of Ephraim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.</p>

  <p>51 These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.</p>
