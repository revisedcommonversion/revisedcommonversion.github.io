  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the first-born of Joseph, namely, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead. Because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</p>

  <p>3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." Therefore, according to the commandment of the LORD, he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. 5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan, 6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. And the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.</p>

  <p>7 And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lies before Shechem, and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. 9 And the border descended to the Kanah River, southward of the river. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. Then the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and its limits were at the sea, 10 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border. And they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. 11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher, Beth-shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Tanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even three countries. 12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel the inhabitants of those cities. But the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly expel them.</p>

  <p>14 And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people because the LORD has until now blessed me?" 15 And Joshua answered them, "If you are a great people, then go up to the wood, and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for you." 16 And the children of Joseph said, "The hill is not enough for us. And all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of ironâ€”both those who are of Beth-shean and its towns, and those who are of the valley of Jezreel." 17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, "You are a great people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only. 18 But the mountain shall be yours. Although it is a wood, you shall cut it down. And its limits shall be yours, for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong."</p>
