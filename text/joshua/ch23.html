  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass, a long time after the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old and advanced in age. 2 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, "I am old and advanced in age. 3 And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you, for the LORD your God is he who has fought for you. 4 Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations which remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations which I have cut off, even to the Great Sea westward. 5 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight, and you shall possess their land, as the LORD your God has promised to you. 6 Therefore, be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that you do not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left, 7 That you do not come among these nations, these which remain among you, neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them. 8 But cleave to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day. 9 For the LORD has driven out from before you great and strong nations. But as for you, no man has been able to stand before you to this day. 10 One man of you shall chase a thousand, for the LORD your God, it is he who fights for you, as he has promised you. 11 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love the LORD your God. 12 But if you do in any way go back and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even those who remain among you, and make marriages with them and associate with them, and they with you, 13 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no longer drive out any of these nations from before you, but they shall be snares and traps to you, scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes until you perish from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you.</p>

  <p>14 "And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you. All have come to pass to you, and not one thing has failed of it. 15 Therefore, it shall come to pass, that as all good things have come upon you which the LORD your God promised you, so the LORD shall bring upon you all evil things until he has destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you. 16 If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them, then the anger of the LORD shall be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you."</p>
