  <p>1 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote and possessed their land on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the Arnon River, to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east: 2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the Arnon River, and from the middle of the river and from half Gilead, even to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3 And from the plain to the sea of Cinneroth on the east and to the sea of the plain, even the Salt Sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah; 4 And the border of Og king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Rephaim, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 5 And reigned over mount Hermon, in Salcah and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites, the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 6 Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the children of Israel smote them. And Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.</p>

  <p>7 And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of the Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, even to the mount Halak that goes up to Seirâ€”which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions, 8 In the mountains, in the valleys, in the plains, in the springs, in the wilderness, and in the south country, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 9 The king of Jericho one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one; 10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 11 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 13 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 16 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one; 17 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 18 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 19 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 20 The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 22 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 23 The king of Dor in the border of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; 24 The king of Tirzah, one. In all, there were thirty-one kings.</p>
