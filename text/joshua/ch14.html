  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them. 2 Their inheritance was by lot, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and for the half-tribe. 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; therefore, they gave no part to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. 5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</p>

  <p>6 Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, "You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadesh-barnea. 7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. 8 Nevertheless, my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the LORD my God. 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your children's forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.' 10 And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty-five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. 11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out and to come in. 12 Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the LORD spoke in that day, for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. If the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said."</p>

  <p>13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, Hebron for an inheritance. 14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day because he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel. 15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba. (This Arba was a great man among the Anakims.) And the land had rest from war.</p>
