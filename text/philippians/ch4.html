    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">From particular admonitions, 1-3, Paul proceeds to general exhortations, 4-9, showing how he rejoiced at their liberality toward him lying in prison, not so much for the supply of his own lack as for the grace of God in them, 10-18. And so he concludes with prayer and salutations, 19-23.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, my brothers dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, likewise stand firm in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</p>
  
  <p>2 I exhort Euodias, and exhort Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 3 And I entreat you also, true companion, help those women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with my other fellow-laborers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
  
  <p>4 Rejoice in the Lord always. And again I say, rejoice. 5 Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. 6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>
  
  <p>8 Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, think on these things. 9 Do those things which you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.</p>
  
  <p>10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your concern for me has flourished again. You were indeed concerned for me, but you lacked opportunity. 11 It is not that I speak from being in need. For I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content with that. 12 I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. 14 But you have done well that you shared in my affliction.</p>
  
  <p>15 Now, Philippians, know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me concerning giving and receiving, but you only. 16 For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again for my needs. 17 It is not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 18 But I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God. 19 But my God will supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 20 Now to God and our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
  
  <p>21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you. 22 All the saints salute you, chiefly those who are of Caesar's household.</p>
  
  <p>23 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
