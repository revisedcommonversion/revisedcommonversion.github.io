  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you so that it may be well with you? 2 And now, is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor. 3 Therefore, wash yourself, anoint yourself, put your clothing upon yourself, and go down to the floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 4 And it shall be when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he lies, and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay yourself down, and he will tell you what you shall do." 5 And she said to her, "All that you say to me I will do."</p>

  <p>6 And she went down to the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her. 7 And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid herself down. 8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid and turned himself, and behold, a woman lay at his feet. 9 And he said, "Who are you?" And she answered, "I am Ruth your handmaid. Therefore, spread your skirt over your handmaid, for you are a near kinsman." 10 And he said, "Blessed are you of the LORD, my daughter. For you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning because you did not follow young men, whether poor or rich. 11 And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do to you all that you require, for all the city of my people knows that you are a virtuous woman. 12 And now it is true that I am your near kinsman. Yet there is a kinsman nearer than I am. 13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, good. Let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then I will do the part of a kinsman to you, as the LORD lives. Lie down until the morning."</p>

  <p>14 And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose before one could know another. And he said, "Do not let it be known that a woman came to the floor." 15 Also he said, "Bring the veil that you have upon you and hold it." And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. And she went into the city. 16 And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?" And she told her all that the man had done to her. 17 And she said, "These six measures of barley he gave me, for he said to me, 'Do not go empty to your mother-in-law.'" 18 Then she said, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will fall. For the man will not be in rest until he has finished the thing this day."</p>
