  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. And behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. And he said to him, "Ho, such a one! Turn aside, sit down here." And he turned aside and sat down. 2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down here." And they sat down. 3 And he said to the kinsman, "Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, sells a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's. 4 And I thought to advertise it to you, saying, 'Buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it. But if you will not redeem it, then tell me, so that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you, and I am after you." And he said, "I will redeem it." 5 Then Boaz said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also accept Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance." 6 And the kinsman said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. Redeem my right for yourself, for I cannot redeem it."</p>

  <p>7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things: a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor, and this was a testimony in Israel. 8 Therefore, the kinsman said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself." So he drew off his shoe. 9 And Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, "You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi. 10 Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, so that the name of the dead is not cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses this day." 11 And all the people who were in the gate and the elders said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, both of whom built the house of Israel. And may you do worthily in Ephratah and be famous in Beth-lehem. 12 And let your house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give you of this young woman."</p>

  <p>13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife. And when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son. 14 And the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the LORD who has not left you this day without a kinsman. May his name be famous in Israel. 15 And he shall be to you a restorer of your life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him."</p>

  <p>16 And Naomi took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became his nurse. 17 And the women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, "There is a son born to Naomi." And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>

  <p>18 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begot Hezron, 19 Hezron begot Ram, Ram begot Amminadab, 20 Amminadab begot Nahshon, Nahshon begot Salmon, 21 Salmon begot Boaz, Boaz begot Obed, 22 Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.5] - "accept" - The Latin text uses the word, accipere, which means, "to accept." Originally written as, "you must buy it also of Ruth..."</p>
  <p>[v.18-22] - This genealogy of Phares also belongs to the genealogy of Christ. See Matthew 1:3-6.</p>
