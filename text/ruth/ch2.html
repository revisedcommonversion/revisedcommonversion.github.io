  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. 2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me now go to the field and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I shall find grace." And she said to her, "Go, my daughter." 3 And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. 4 And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem and said to the reapers, "May the LORD be with you." And they answered him, "May the LORD bless you." 5 Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, "Whose damsel is this?" 6 And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, "It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 7 And she said, 'I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.' So she came and has continued even from the morning until now, and she tarried a little in the house."</p>

  <p>8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field, neither go from here, but abide here close by my maidens. 9 Let your eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch you? And when you are thirsty go to the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn." 10 Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, "Why have I found grace in your eyes that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?" 11 And Boaz answered and said to her, "It has fully been shown to me all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your nativity and have come to a people which you did not know before. 12 May the LORD recompense your work, and a full reward be given you by the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to trust." 13 Then she said, "Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not like one of your handmaidens."</p>

  <p>14 And Boaz said to her, "At meal-time, come here and eat some of the bread and dip your morsel in the vinegar." And she sat beside the reapers, and he gave her parched grain, and she ate, was satisfied, and left. 15 And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. 16 And also let some of the handfuls fall on purpose for her, and leave them so that she may glean them. And do not rebuke her."</p>

  <p>17 So she gleaned in the field until evening and beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 18 And she took it and went into the city. And her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought forth and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied. 19 And her mother-in-law said to her, "Where have you gleaned today? And where have you labored? Blessed is he who took knowledge of you." And she revealed to her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, "The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz." 20 And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, "Blessed is he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead." And Naomi said to her, "The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen." 21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, "He also said to me, 'You shall keep close by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.'" 22 And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you should go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field." 23 So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz to glean until the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest, and dwelt with her mother-in-law.</p>
