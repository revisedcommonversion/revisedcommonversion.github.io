    <p class="ch-outline">The Jews slay their enemies and the ten sons of Haman, 1-11. Ahasuerus, at the request of Esther, grants another day of slaughter and Haman's sons to be hanged, 12-19. The two days of Purim are made a festival, 20-32.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar), on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over those who hated them), 2 The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of king Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their hurt. And no man could withstand them, for the fear of them fell upon all people. 3 And all the rulers of the provinces, the lieutenants, the deputies, and officers of the king helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them. 4 For Mordecai was great in the king's house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces, for this man Mordecai became greater and greater. 5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter, and with destruction, and did what they pleased to those who hated them. 6 And in the palace of Shushan the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 7 And they slew Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha, 10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.</p>

  <p>11 On that day the number of those who were slain in the palace of Shushan was brought before the king. 12 And the king said to Esther the queen, "The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the palace of Shushan and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your request further? It shall be done." 13 Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows." 14 And the king commanded it to be done so. And the decree was given at Shushan, and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 15 For the Jews who were in Shushan assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar and slew three hundred men at Shushan. But on the plunder they did not lay their hands.</p>

  <p>16 But the other Jews who were in the king's provinces assembled and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy-five thousand (but they did not lay their hands on the plunder) 17 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar. And on the fourteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>

  <p>18 But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day of the month and on the fourteenth day. And on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. 19 Therefore, the Jews of the villages, who dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions to one another.</p>

  <p>20 And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, both near and far, 21 To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22 As the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned for them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions to one another, and gifts to the poor.</p>

  <p>23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun and as Mordecai had written to them, 24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur (that is, the lot) to consume them and to destroy them. 25 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan which he devised against the Jews should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 26 Therefore, they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them, 27 The Jews ordained and took upon themselves, upon their descendants, and upon all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year, 28 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their memorial perish from their descendants.</p>

  <p>29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim. 30 And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 31 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their descendants, the matters of the fastings and their cry. 32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim, and it was written in the book.</p>
