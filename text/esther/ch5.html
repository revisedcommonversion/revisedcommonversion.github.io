    <p class="ch-outline">Esther, adventuring on the king's favor, obtains the grace of the golden scepter and invites the king and Haman to a banquet, 1-5.

  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. 2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter. 3 Then the king said to her, "What do you wish, queen Esther? And what is your request? It shall be given to you even to the half of the kingdom." 4 And Esther answered, "If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him."</p>

  <p>5 Then the king said, "Cause Haman to make haste so that he may do as Esther has said." So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 6 And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed." 7 Then Esther answered, and said, "My petition and my request is this: 8 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."</p>

  <p>9 Then Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and that he did not stand up, nor move for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai. 10 Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself. And when he came home, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife. 11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 12 Haman said moreover, "Even Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself. And tomorrow I am invited to her also with the king. 13 Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate." 14 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak to the king so that Mordecai may be hanged upon it. Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet." And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.</p>
