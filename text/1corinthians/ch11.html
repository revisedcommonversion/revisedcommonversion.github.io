  <p>1 Be followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>

  <p>2 Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you. 3 But I wish to have you know, that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 4 Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered dishonors his head. 5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is even one and the same as if she were shaved. 6 For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn, but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. 7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. 8 For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man, 9 Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man. 10 For this cause, the woman ought to have power on her head, because of the angels. 11 Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. 12 For as the woman is from the man, even so is the man also by the woman, but all things from God. 13 Judge for yourselves. Is it proper that a woman should pray to God uncovered? 14 Does even nature itself not teach you, that if a man has long hair, it is a shame to him? 15 But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering. 16 But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>

  <p>17 Now in this that I declare to you I do not praise you, that you do not come together for the better, but for the worse. 18 For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it. 19 For there must also be sects among you so that those who are approved may be made manifest among you. 20 When therefore you come together in one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. 21 For in eating each one takes before another his own supper. And one is hungry and another is drunken. 22 What? Do you not have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.</p>

  <p>23 For I have received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. 24 And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me." 25 After the same manner, he also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me." 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.</p>

  <p>27 Therefore, whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and likewise let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. 29 For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 30 For this cause, many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord so that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>

  <p>33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. 34 And if any man hungers, let him eat at home so that you do not come together to condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</p>
