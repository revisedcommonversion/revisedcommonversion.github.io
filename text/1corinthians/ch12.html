    <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Spiritual gifts, 1-3, are diverse, 4-6, yet given to every man for profit, 7. And to that end are diversely bestowed, 8-11; so that by similar proportion, as the members of a natural body tend all to the mutual decency, 12-21, service, 22-25, and succor of the same body, 26; we should also do for one another, to make up the body of Christ, 27-31.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I wish to not have you ignorant. 2 You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these mute idols, even as you were led. 3 Therefore, I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <p>4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who works all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit. 8 For by the Spirit the word of wisdom is given to one; to another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 9 To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 10 To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of languages; to another, the interpretation of languages. 11 But the one and the same Spirit works all these, dividing to every man separately as he wills.</p>

  <p>12 For as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free, and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.</p>

  <p>14 For the body is not one member, but many. 15 If the foot says, "Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 16 And if the ear says, "Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be? 18 But now God has set each of the members in the body as it has pleased him. 19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be? 20 But now they are many members, but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." 22 Contrarily, much rather those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary, 23 And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor. And our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty, 24 But our presentable parts have no need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked, 25 So that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. 26 And thus if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it, or, if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

  <p>27 Now you are the body of Christ and members in particular. 28 And God has set some in the church: first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and diversities of languages. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 30 Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all speak in languages? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly covet the best gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.</p>
