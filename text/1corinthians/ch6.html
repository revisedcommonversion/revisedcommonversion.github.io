    <p class="ch-outline">The Corinthians must not vex their brothers in going to law with them, 1-5; especially under infidels, 6-8. The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God, 9-14.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust and not before the saints? 2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more things that pertain to this life? 4 If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? Not even one who will be able to judge between his brothers? 6 But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</p>

  <p>7 Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you because you go to law with one another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded? 8 But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brothers.</p>

  <p>9 Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you are washed, you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

  <p>12 "All things are lawful to me," but all things are not expedient. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be brought under the power of any. 13 "Foods for the belly and the belly for foods," but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for lewdness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 14 And God has both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his own power. 15 Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? By no means. 16 Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For he says, "<cite>The two shall be one flesh.</cite>" 17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 18 Flee lewdness. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits lewdness sins against his own body. 19 Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you are bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</p>
