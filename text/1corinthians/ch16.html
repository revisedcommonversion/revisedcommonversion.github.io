  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, you are to do likewise. 2 Upon the first day of the week, let each of you lay by him in store as God has prospered him so that there are no collections when I come. 3 And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters, I will send them to bring your liberality to Jerusalem. 4 And if it is proper that I should also go, they shall go with me.</p>

  <p>5 Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I am to pass through Macedonia. 6 And it may be that I shall abide and even winter with you so that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go. 7 For I do not wish to see you merely in passing, but I trust to remain a while with you, if the Lord permits. 8 But I shall remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, 9 For a great and effectual door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>

  <p>10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear, for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do. 11 Let no man therefore despise him. But conduct him forth in peace so that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brothers.</p>

  <p>12 As concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers, but his will was not at all to come at this time. But he will come when he has convenient time.</p>

  <p>13 Watch, stand firm in the faith, acquit yourselves like men, and be strong. 14 Let all your things be done with charity.</p>

  <p>15 I implore you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints— 16 That you submit yourselves to such as these and to everyone who helps with us and labors. 17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for that which was lacking on your part, they have supplied, 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, acknowledge those who are such.</p>

  <p>19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, along with the church that is in their house. 20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>

  <p>21 The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand. 22 If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maran-atha. 23 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 24 May my love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
