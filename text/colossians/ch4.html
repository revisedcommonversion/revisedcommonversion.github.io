  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
  
  <p>2 Continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving, 3 At the same time also praying for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, 4 So that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
  
  <p>5 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. 6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</p>
  
  <p>7 All my state Tychicus shall declare to you, who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellow-servant in the Lord, 8 Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose so that you may know our state and that he may comfort your hearts, 9 And with him, Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are done here.</p>
  
  <p>10 Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, salutes you, along with Marcus, nephew of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments—if he should come to you, receive him), 11 And Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These are my only fellow-workers to the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort to me. 12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 13 For I bear him testimony, that he has a great zeal for you and those who are in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis. 14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you. 15 Salute the brothers who are in Laodicea and also Nymphas and the church that is in his house. 16 And when this epistle is read among you, see to it that it also be read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. 17 And say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it."</p>
  
  <p>18 The salutation by the hand of me, Paul. Remember my bonds. May grace be with you. Amen.</p>
