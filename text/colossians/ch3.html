  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 If you then are raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God. 2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 3 For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. 4 When Christ, who is our life, appears, you will also appear with him in glory.</p>
  
  <p>5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: lewdness, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry. 6 Because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience, 7 In which you also walked formerly when you lived in them. 8 But now you also put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and filthy communication out of your mouth. 9 Do not lie to one another, seeing you have put off the old man with his deeds, 10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him who created him, 11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all and in all.</p>
  
  <p>12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, hearts of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, patience, 13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man has a quarrel against any. Just as Christ forgave you, so also should you. 14 And above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which you are also called in one body, and be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
  
  <p>18 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. 21 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</p>
  
  <p>22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. 23 And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, 24 Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord Christ. 25 But he who does wrong will receive for the wrong which he has done. And there is no respect of persons.</p>
