  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 For I wish that you knew what great conflict I have for you and for those at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, 2 That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ, 3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 4 And this I say, lest any man should deceive you with enticing words. 5 For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</p>
  
  <p>6 As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, 7 Rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</p>
  
  <p>8 Beware lest any man make a prey of you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 9 For in him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily. 10 And you are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power. 11 In him you are also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, 12 Buried with him in baptism, in which you are also raised with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead. 13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has made alive together with him, having forgiven you of all trespasses, 14 Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross. 15 And having disarmed the principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
  
  <p>16 Let no man therefore judge you in food, in drink, in respect of a holy-day, of the new-moon, or of the sabbaths, 17 Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ. 18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 19 And not holding the head, from which all the body, being supplied and knit together by joints and ligaments, increases with the increase of God.</p>
  
  <p>20 Therefore, if you are dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances 21 ("Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle," 22 Which are all to perish with use), according to the commandments and doctrines of men? 23 These things have indeed a show of wisdom in will-worship, humility, and neglecting of the body, but not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>
