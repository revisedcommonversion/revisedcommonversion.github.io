  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood. Two and a half cubits was its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height. 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside and made a crown of gold for it all around. 3 And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set by its four corners, even two rings upon one side of it and two rings upon the other side of it. 4 And he made staffs of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold. 5 And he put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark to bear the ark. 6 And he made the mercy-seat of pure gold. Two and a half cubits was its length and one cubit and a half its breadth. 7 And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the mercy-seat: 8 One cherub on the end on this side and another cherub on the other end on that side. Of one piece with the mercy-seat he made the cherubim on its two ends. 9 And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces to one another, even toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.</p>

  <p>10 And he made the table of shittim wood. Two cubits was its length, a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height. 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold and made for it a crown of gold all around. 12 Also he made for it a border of a hand-breadth all around and made a crown of gold for its border all around. 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold and put the rings upon the four corners that were on its four feet. 14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staffs, to bear the table. 15 And he made the staffs of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold to bear the table. 16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, its dishes, its spoons, its bowls, and its covers to cover with, of pure gold.</p>

  <p>17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold. Of beaten work he made the candlestick. Its shaft, its branch, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers were of the same. 18 And there were six branches proceeding from its sides: three branches of the candlestick from one side of it and three branches of the candlestick from the other side of it. 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knob and a flower, and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knob and a flower—likewise throughout the six branches proceeding from the candlestick. 20 And in the candlestick there were four bowls made like almonds, its knobs and its flowers, 21 And a knob under two branches of the same, a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches proceeding from it. 22 Their knobs and their branches were of the same. All of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 23 And he made its seven lamps, its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes of pure gold. 24 Of a talent of pure gold he made it and all its vessels.</p>

  <p>25 And he made the incense-altar of shittim wood. Its length was a cubit and its breadth a cubit. It was square and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of the same. 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both its top and its sides all around and its horns. He also made for it a crown of gold all around. 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under its crown, by its two corners, upon its two sides, to be places for the staffs to bear it with. 28 And he made the staffs of shittim wood and overlaid them with gold. 29 And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices according to the work of the perfumer.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1-29] - For a more detailed explanation of the ark and the various things mentioned in this chapter, see the notes for Exodus, ch. 25 and 30.</p>
  <p>[v.6-9] - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "We cannot sufficiently keep in view him, whom both the ark, and mercy-seat, typified. Jesus is the mercy-seat, or propitiation. 1st John 2:1. And to the shelter of his righteousness was it not that Noah by faith fled? Genesis 7:1 with Hebrews 11:7."</p>
  <p>[v.10-16] - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "Was not the table of show-bread meant also to show forth the everlasting duration of Jesus as the bread of life to his people? The show-bread was always to be spread upon the table, and Jesus is always in the presence of God for us. But Reader, do not overlook the vast superiority of the gospel table to the law. The show-bread was always upon the table indeed, but it was only to be looked upon, not eaten, except by the priests: but under the gospel, Jesus is to be both looked upon, and received. See his words, Proverbs 9:5."</p>
  <p>[v.17-24] - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "Was not this candlestick an emblem of the light of the Holy Spirit, and of his sacred word? Has not the church been enlightened with the illuminations of the Spirit, in all ages? Revelation 1:20, 2:7; Psalm 119:105. And are not the branches of the candlestick meant to show that the supply of believers is from Christ?. Zechariah 4:2-3. But Reader! Do not forget that after all, a candlestick is but a faint light. Divine communications in this world are but as the light of a candle. The full day-light of glory, in the Lord Jesus, is reserved for the upper world. 1st Corinthians 13:12."</p>
  <p>[v.25-28] - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "Was not this incense altar a type of the Lord Jesus? Is he not both the altar and incense of his people? Hebrews 13:15; Revelation 8:3."</p>
  <p>[v.29] - This oil represented the graces of the Holy Spirit. See the notes for Exodus 30:25.</p>
