  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "If a man steals an ox or a sheep and kills it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.</p>

  <p>2 "If a thief is found breaking through and is smitten so that he dies, there shall no blood be shed for him. 3 If the sun has risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him, for he should make full restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 4 If the theft is certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall restore double.</p>

  <p>5 "If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and puts in his beast and feeds in another man's field, of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard he shall make restitution.</p>

  <p>6 "If fire breaks out and catches in thorns and then stacks of corn, standing corn, or a field is consumed, he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>

  <p>7 "If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep and it is stolen out of the man's house, if the thief is found, let him pay double. 8 If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he has put his hand to his neighbor's goods. 9 For all manner of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any manner of lost thing which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges. And he whom the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.</p>

  <p>10 "If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any beast to keep and it dies, is hurt, or is driven away, no man seeing it, 11 Then an oath of the LORD shall be between them both that he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods. And its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution. 12 And if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner. 13 If it is torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>

  <p>14 "And if a man borrows anything from his neighbor and it is hurt or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make it good. 15 But if its owner is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a hired thing, it came for his hire.</p>

  <p>16 "And if a man entices a maid who is not betrothed and lies with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 17 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>

  <p>18 "You shall not allow a witch to live.</p>

  <p>19 "Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>

  <p>20 "He who sacrifices to any god, except to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</p>

  <p>21 "You shall neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 22 You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child. 23 If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry. 24 And my wrath shall wax hot and I will kill you with the sword. And your wives shall be widows and your children fatherless.</p>

  <p>25 "If you lend money to any of my people who is poor by you, you shall not be to him as a creditor, neither shall you lay upon him usury. 26 If you ever take your neighbor's clothing to pledge, you shall deliver it to him by the setting of the sun. 27 For that is his only covering, it is his clothing for his skin. Wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am gracious.</p>

  <p>28 "You shall not revile God, nor curse the ruler of your people.</p>

  <p>29 "You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits and of your liquors. The first-born of your sons you shall give to me. 30 You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep. Seven days it shall be with his mother. On the eighth day you shall give it to me.</p>

  <p>31 "And you shall be holy men to me; therefore, you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field. You shall cast it to the dogs."</p>
