  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Behold, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 3 And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4 To devise skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass, 5 In cutting of stones to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan. And in the hearts of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom so that they may make all that I have commanded you: 7 The Tabernacle of the Congregation, the ark of the testimony, the mercy-seat that is upon it, all the vessels of the tabernacle, 8 The table and its vessels, the pure candlestick with all its vessels, the altar of incense, 9 The altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, the basin and its foot, 10 The clothes of service, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office, 11 And the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do."</p>

  <p>12 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 13 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Truly you shall keep my sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 14 You shall keep the sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death, for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the sabbath-day, he shall surely be put to death. 16 Therefore, the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant. 17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever, for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'"</p>

  <p>18 And to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, he gave two tablets of testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/exodus/MHC%20-%20Exodus%2C%20Chapter%2031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Exodus, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1-6] - Reference, Job 38:36; Isaiah 28:26; 1st Corinthians 12:4-11; Ephesians 4:11-13.</p>
  <p>[v.7-11] - From Robert Hawker's Commentary: "If the Lord was graciously pleased to qualify men for the adorning of the tabernacle, which was but a shadow of good things to come, what may we not suppose the same gracious Lord will do, in qualifying ministers, under the gospel dispensation, for the building up of believers, which are the body of Christ. Ephesians 4:11-13."</p>
  <p>[v.18a] - "two tablets of testimony" - From John Gill's Exposition: "The two tablets of the law, which is a testimony of the will of God, and contained the duty of the Israelites both toward God and man, and are reducible to these two, love to God, and love to our neighbor: five of the commands of the decalogue were written on one tablet, and five on the other; or it may be rather four on one tablet, the first being the largest, and containing the duty owing to God, and six on the other, which regard the duty of men one to another... [Their being constructed of stone] may denote the firmness, stability, and duration of the law, not as in the hands of Moses, from which these tablets were cast and broke, but as in the hands of Christ, and laid up in him the ark of the covenant, the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness: and it may also figure the hardness of man's heart, which is destitute of spiritual life, obdurate and impenitent, obtuse, senseless and ignorant, stubborn and inflexible, and not subject to the law of God, and on which no impressions can be made but by the power and grace of God."</p>
  <p>[v.18b] - "written with the finger of God" - From John Gill's Exposition: "By God himself, and not by an angel, or by any creature or instrument: and it is by the finger of God, the Spirit, grace, and power of God, that the laws of God are put into the inward part, and written on the heart, to which the apostle refers (2nd Corinthians 3:3)."</p>
