  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD said to Moses, "Yet I will bring one more plague upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he shall surely thrust you out from here altogether. 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver and jewels of gold." 3 And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.</p>

  <p>4 And Moses said, "Thus says the LORD: 'About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt. 5 And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne, even to the first-born of the woman-servant who is behind the mill, and all the first-born of beasts. 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. 7 But against any of the children of Israel a dog shall not move his tongue, against man or beast, so that you may know how the LORD puts a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.' 8 And all these servants of yours shall come down to me and bow down themselves to me, saying, 'Depart—you and all the people who follow you.' And after that I will depart." And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.</p>

  <p>9 And the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt." 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land.</p>
