  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 2 And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3 And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 5 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. 6 But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward to the east country.</p>

  <p>7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years. 8 Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, 10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</p>

  <p>12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham. 13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15 Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their towns and by their castles, twelve princes according to their nations. 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years. And he expired and died and was gathered to his people. 18 And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as far as toward Assyria. And he died in the presence of all his brothers.</p>

  <p>19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac. 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to be his wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 21 And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 22 And the children struggled together within her, and she said, "If it is so, why am I thus?" And she went to inquire of the LORD.</p>

  <p>23 And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your body. One people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger."</p>

  <p>24 And when her days to deliver were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 25 And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau. 26 And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold of Esau's heel, and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>

  <p>27 And the boys grew. And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents. 28 And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his venison, but Rebekah loved Jacob. 29 And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field and he was faint. 30 And Esau said to Jacob, "Feed me, I pray you, with that same red pottage, for I am faint." Therefore, his name was called Edom. 31 And Jacob said, "Sell to me this day your birth-right." 32 And Esau said, "Behold, I am at the point to die, and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?" 33 And Jacob said, "Swear to me this day." And he swore to him and sold his birth-right to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birth-right.</p>
