  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And to them sons were born after the flood.</p>

  <p>2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5 By these the islands of the Gentiles were divided in their lands, each after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</p>

  <p>6 And the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. 7 And the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. 8 And Cush begot Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth. 9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore, it is said, "Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD." 10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 11 Out of that land Ashur went forth and built Nineveh, the city Rehoboth, Calah, 12 And Resen, between Nineveh and Calahâ€”the same is a great city. 13 And Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 14 Pathrusim, Casluhim (out of whom came Philistim), and Caphtorim.</p>

  <p>15 And Canaan begot Sidon his first-born, Heth, 16 The Jebusite, the Emorite, the Girgasite, 17 The Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite, 18 The Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. And afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as far as to Gerar, to Gaza, as far as to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah. 20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.</p>

  <p>21 To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him children were born. 22 The children of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 23 And the children of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 24 And Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. 25 And to Eber two sons were born: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan. 26 And Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as far as to Sephar, a mountain of the east. 31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p>

  <p>32 These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations. And by these the nations were divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
