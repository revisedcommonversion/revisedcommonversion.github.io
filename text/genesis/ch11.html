  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 2 And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there. 3 And they said to one another, "Come, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly." And they had brick for stone and they had slime for mortar. 4 And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven. And let us make ourselves a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth." 5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men were building. 6 And the LORD said, "Behold, the people are one and they all have one language. And this they begin to do, and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have purposed to do. 7 Come, let us go down and there confound their language so that they may not understand one another's speech." 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there upon the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. 9 Therefore, its name is called Babel, because there the LORD confounded the language of all the earth. And from there the LORD scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

  <p>10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood. 11 And Shem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hundred years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>12 And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years and begot Salah. 13 And Arphaxad lived after he begot Salah four hundred and three years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>14 And Salah lived thirty years and begot Eber. 15 And Salah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>16 And Eber lived thirty-four years and begot Peleg. 17 And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>18 And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu. 19 And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>20 And Reu lived thirty-two years and begot Serug. 21 And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>22 And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor. 23 And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>24 And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and begot Terah. 25 And Nahor lived after he begot Terah one hundred and nineteen years and begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>26 And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>

  <p>27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begot Lot. 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29 And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah. 30 But Sarai was barren. She had no child.</p>

  <p>31 And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran his son's son and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan. And they came to Haran and dwelt there. 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.9] - "Babel" - LXX: <span class="gr-heb">Σύγχυσις</span>—Confusion.</p>
  <p>[v.12-13] - The genealogy differs a little in the Septuagint, where Cainan is mentioned as the son of Arphaxad and the father of Salah. See note for Luke 3:34-38.</p>
