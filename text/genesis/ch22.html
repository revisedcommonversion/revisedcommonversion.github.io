  <p>1 And it came to pass after these things, that God tested Abraham and said to him, "Abraham." And he said, "Behold, here I am." 2 And he said, "Now take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to you." 3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son, split the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. 5 And Abraham said to his young men, "Abide here with the donkey, and the boy and I will go yonder and worship and return to you." 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and laid it upon Isaac his son, and he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and the both of them went together. 7 And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father." And he said, "Here I am, my son." And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" 8 And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering." So the both of them went together.</p>

  <p>9 And they came to the place which God had named to him. And Abraham built an altar there, laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11 And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Here I am." 12 And he said, "Do not lay your hand upon the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld from me your son, your only son." 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered him for a burnt-offering instead of his son. 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide, as it is said to this day, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be seen."</p>

  <p>15 And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time, 16 And said, "By myself I have sworn, says the LORD, for because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the sea shore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies. 18 And in your offspring all the nations of the earth shall be blessed because you have obeyed my voice." 19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba, and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</p>

  <p>20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, "Behold, Milcah, she has also borne children to your brother Nahor: 21 Huz his first-born, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel." 23 And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother. 24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.</p>
