  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD said to Noah, "Come—you and all your house—into the ark. For I have seen you righteous before me in this generation. 2 Of every clean beast you shall take with you by sevens, the male and his female, and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female, 3 Of birds of the air also by sevens, the male and the female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth. 4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights. And every living substance that I have made I will destroy from the face of the earth." 5 And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.</p>

  <p>6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth. 7 And Noah went in, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8 Of clean beasts, of beasts that are not clean, of birds, and of every animal that creeps upon the earth, 9 There went in two and two with Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up and the windows of heaven were opened. 12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>

  <p>13 In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth (the sons of Noah), Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark— 14 They, every beast after its kind, all the cattle after their kind, every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind—every bird of every sort. 15 And they went in with Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life. 16 And those that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And the LORD shut him in.</p>

  <p>17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth. And the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth. 18 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark moved upon the face of the waters. 19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered. 20 Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered. 21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, of bird, of cattle, of beast, of every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth, and every man. 22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died. 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground—man, cattle, the creeping animals, and the bird of heaven—and they were destroyed from the earth. And only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive. 24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.</p>
