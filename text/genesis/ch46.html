  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2 And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob." And he said, "Here I am." 3 And he said, "I am God, the God of your father. Do not fear to go down into Egypt. For I will make you a great nation there. 4 I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again. And Joseph shall put his hand upon your eyes."</p>

  <p>5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba. And the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 6 And they took their cattle and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt—Jacob and all his family with him: 7 His sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters. He brought all his family with him into Egypt.</p>

  <p>8 And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt—Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born. 9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12 And the sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Pharez, and Zerah, but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron. 14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 15 These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three. 16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggai, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 17 And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah. Serah was their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. 19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20 And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him. 21 And the sons of Benjamin: Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 22 These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob. All the souls were fourteen. 23 And the son of Dan: Hushim. 24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob. All the souls were seven. 26 All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty-six. 27 And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.</p>

  <p>28 And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to direct his face to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen. 29 And Joseph made ready his chariot and went to meet Israel his father at Goshen. And he presented himself to him, fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 30 And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die since I have seen your face, because you are still alive." 31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's house, "I will go up and show Pharaoh, and say to him, 'My brothers and my father's house who were in the land of Canaan have come to me. 32 And the men are shepherds, for their employment has been to feed cattle. And they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.' 33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh calls you and says, 'What is your occupation?' 34 You shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now—both we and also our fathers,' so that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.4] - "And Joseph shall put his hand upon your eyes" - From John Gill's Exposition: "And so close them when he was dead; this, as Aben Ezra says, was a custom of the living to the dead, and it used to be done by the nearest relations and friends, though now with us commonly by strangers, or those that are not akin... Now by this expression Jacob was assured that Joseph was alive, and that he should live to see him, and that Joseph would outlive him, and do this last office for him; and, as Ben Melech observes, by this he had the good news told him that Joseph should remain behind him, to sustain and support his sons, and his sons' sons, all the years that he should live after him."</p>
  <p>[v.27] - Reference, Exodus 1:5.</p>
