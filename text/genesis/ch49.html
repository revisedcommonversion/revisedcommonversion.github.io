  <p>1 And Jacob called to his sons and said, "Assemble yourselves so that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Assemble yourselves and hear, sons of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and listen to Israel your father.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Reuben, you are my first-born,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my might, and the beginning of my strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Unstable as water, you shall not excel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because you went up to your father's bed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then you defiled it—he went up to my couch.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> "Simeon and Levi are brothers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> O my soul, do not come into their secret.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To their assembly, my honor, do not be united,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for in their anger they slew a man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in their self-will they dug down a wall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Cursed is their anger, for it was fierce,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their wrath, for it was cruel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will divide them in Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and scatter them in Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> "Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Your father's children shall bow down before you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Judah is a lion's whelp.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From the prey, my son, you have gone up.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He stooped down. He couched like a lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and like an old lion. Who shall rouse him up?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The scepter shall not depart from Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor a lawgiver from between his feet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until Shiloh comes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And to him shall be the gathering of the people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Binding his foal to the vine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his donkey's colt to the choice vine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he washed his garments in wine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his clothes in the blood of grapes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> His eyes shall be red with wine<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his teeth white with milk.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> "Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall be for a haven of ships.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And his border shall be to Zidon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "Issachar is a strong donkey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />couching down between two burdens.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And he saw that rest was good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the land that it was pleasant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bowed his shoulder to bear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and became a servant to tribute.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> "Dan shall judge his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Dan shall be a serpent by the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />an adder in the path<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that bites the horse-heels<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> "Gad, a troop shall overcome him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he shall overcome at the last.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> "Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> "Naphtali is a doe let loose,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who gives delightful words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "Joseph is a fruitful bough,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even a fruitful bough by a well,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose branches run over the wall.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The archers have sorely grieved him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shot at him, and hated him,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> But his bow remained in strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the arms of his hands were made strong<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Even by the God of your father who shall help you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by the Almighty who shall bless you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with blessings of heaven above,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blessings of the deep that lies beneath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> The blessings of your father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be on the head of Joseph,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the morning he shall devour the prey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and at night he shall divide the plunder."</p>
  </div>

  <p>28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. And this is that which their father spoke to them and blessed them. Each according to his blessing he blessed them. 29 And he charged them and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a burying-place. 31 (There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.) 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it was from the children of Heth." 33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and expired, and was gathered to his people.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/genesis/MHC%20-%20Genesis%2C%20Chapter%2049.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Genesis, Chapter 49</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.10a] - This is a prophecy of the Messiah. Initially, this is a reference to David, as the scepter is a symbol of kingship and David is of the house of Judah. In 1st Samuel 16:1 God tells Samuel that He will choose a king from among the sons of Jesse—which son would be David (1st Samuel 16:12-13). God ordained that the throne of David would be established forever through David's lineage (2nd Samuel 7:12-16). Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of the eternal King (Revelation 5:5).</p>
  <p>[v.10b] - LXX: "A ruler shall not fail from Juda, nor a prince from his loins, until there come the things stored up for him; and he is the expectation of nations."</p>
