  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him. 2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. And the physicians embalmed Israel. 3 And forty days were fulfilled for him (for thus they fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed), and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.</p>

  <p>4 And when the days of his mourning had past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 5 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I die. In my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me." Now therefore, let me go, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come back.'" 6 And Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, according as he made you swear."</p>

  <p>7 And Joseph went up to bury his father. And with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8 All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. 9 And both chariots and horsemen went with him. And it was a very great company. 10 And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation. And he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians." Therefore, its name was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</p>

  <p>12 And his sons did to him according as he commanded them. 13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite before Mamre. 14 And Joseph returned to Egypt—he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father—after he had buried his father.</p>

  <p>15 And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "Joseph will perhaps hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him." 16 And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded before he died, saying, 17 'Thus you shall say to Joseph: "Forgive, I pray you now, the trespass of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you."' And now, we pray you, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of your father." And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 And his brothers also went and fell down before his face, and they said, "Behold, we are your servants." 19 And Joseph said to them, "Do not fear. For am I in the place of God? 20 But as for you, you thought evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive. 21 Now therefore, do not fear. I will nourish you and your little ones." And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.</p>

  <p>22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt—he and his father's house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 24 And Joseph said to his brothers, "I die, but God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." 25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here." 26 So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
