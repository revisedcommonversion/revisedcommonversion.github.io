  <p>1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</p>

  <p>2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, 3 And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 4 And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel; 5 And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.</p>

  <p>6 And Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the persons of his house, his cattle, all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 7 For their riches were too abundant for them to dwell together, and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them because of their cattle. 8 Thus Esau dwelt in the mountains of Seir. Esau is Edom.</p>

  <p>9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the mountains of Seir. 10 These are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 11 And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 12 And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau's wife. 13 And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Bashemath, Esau's wife. 14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife, and she bore to Esau, Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.</p>

  <p>15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau: duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek. These are the dukes, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Adah. 17 And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah. These are the dukes, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Bashemath, Esau's wife. 18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau's wife: duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah. These were the dukes, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 19 These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their dukes.</p>

  <p>20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 23 And the children of Shobal were these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 24 And these are the children of Zibeon: Ajah and Anah. This was that Anah who found the mules in the wilderness as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 25 And the children of Anah were these: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 26 And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 27 The children of Ezer are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Achan. 28 The children of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran. 29 These are the dukes, descendants of the Horites: duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan. These are the dukes, descendants of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.</p>

  <p>31 And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead, and the name of his city was Avith. 36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 38 And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 39 And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead, and the name of his city was Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.</p>

  <p>40 And these are the names of the dukes, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 43 Duke Magdiel, and duke Iram. These are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession. He is Esau the father of the Edomites.</p>
