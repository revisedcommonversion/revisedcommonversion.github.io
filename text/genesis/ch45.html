  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all those who stood by him. And he cried, "Cause every man to go out from me." And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. 2 And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 3 And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Does my father still live?" And his brothers could not answer him because they were troubled at his presence.</p>

  <p>4 And Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, I pray you." And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5 Now therefore, do not be grieved, nor angry with yourselves that you sold me here because God sent me before you to preserve life. 6 For these two years the famine has been in the land, and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest. 7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God. And he has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 9 Haste, return to my father, and say to him, 'Thus says your son Joseph: "God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Do not delay. 10 And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen and you shall be near to me—you, your children, your children's children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. 11 And there I will nourish you (for yet there are five years of famine), lest you, your household, and all that you have should come to poverty."' 12 And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you. 13 And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen. And you shall haste and bring down my father here." 14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15 Moreover, he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them. And after that his brothers talked with him.</p>

  <p>16 And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, "Joseph's brothers have come." And it pleased Pharaoh well and his servants. 17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go, return to the land of Canaan, 18 And take your father and your households and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.' 19 Now you are commanded, 'Do this: take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. 20 Also do not regard your belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"</p>

  <p>21 And the children of Israel did so. And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 22 To all of them he gave each man changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 23 And to his father he sent after this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt and ten female donkeys laden with corn, bread, and food for his father by the way.</p>

  <p>24 So he sent his brothers away and they departed. And he said to them, "See that you do not contend by the way." 25 And they went up from Egypt and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father, 26 And told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive and he is governor over all the land of Egypt." And Jacob's heart fainted, for he did not believe them. 27 And they told him all the words of Joseph which he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. 28 And Israel said, "It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."</p>
