  <p>1 And Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 2 Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father, and take for yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother's brother. 3 And may God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful, and multiply you so that you may be a multitude of people, 4 And give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, so that you may inherit the land in which you are a stranger, which God gave to Abraham." 5 And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.</p>

  <p>6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padan-aram to take for himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, "You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan," 7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Padan-aram, 8 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father, 9 Then Esau went to Ishmael and took, besides the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</p>

  <p>10 And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. 11 And he alighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun had set. And he took of the stones of that place and set them for his head-rest and lay down in that place to sleep. 12 And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 13 And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give it to you and to your seed. 14 And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, to the east, to the north, and to the south. And in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed. 15 And behold, I am with you and will keep you in all places where you go and will bring you again into this land. For I will not leave you until I have done that which I have declared to you." 16 And Jacob awoke out of his sleep and he said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it." 17 And he was afraid and said, "How awesome this place is! This is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</p>

  <p>18 And Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on its top. 19 And he called the name of that place Beth-el, but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, keep me in this way that I go, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on, 21 So that I come back to my father's house in peace, then the LORD shall be my God. 22 And this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house. And of all that you give me, I will surely give the tenth to you."</p>
