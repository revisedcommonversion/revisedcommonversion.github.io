  <p>1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in the likeness of God. 2 Male and female he created them, and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created.</p>

  <p>3 And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth. 4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years. And he begot sons and daughters. 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.</p>

  <p>6 And Seth lived one hundred and five years and begot Enos. 7 And Seth lived after he begot Enos eight hundred and seven years and begot sons and daughters. 8 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.</p>

  <p>9 And Enos lived ninety years and begot Cainan. 10 And Enos lived after he begot Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begot sons and daughters. 11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.</p>

  <p>12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begot Mahalaleel. 13 And Cainan lived after he begot Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begot sons and daughters. 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.</p>

  <p>21 And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah. 22 And Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah three hundred years and begot sons and daughters. 23 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 24 And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took him.</p>

  <p>25 And Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech. 26 And Methuselah lived after he begot Lamech seven hundred and eighty-two years and begot sons and daughters. 27 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.</p>

  <p>28 And Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years and begot a son, 29 And he called his name Noah, saying, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD has cursed." 30 And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred and ninety-five years and begot sons and daughters. 31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.</p>
