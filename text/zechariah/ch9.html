    <p class="in-verse">The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Damascus shall be its resting place<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(for the eyes of man and of all the tribes of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be toward the LORD),</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And also Hamath, which borders by it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Tyre and Zidon, because they are very wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And Tyre built herself a stronghold<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and amassed silver as the dust<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Behold, the Lord will dispossess her<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he will smite her power in the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Ashkelon shall see it and fear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Gaza shall also see it and be very sorrowful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as will Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the king shall perish from Gaza,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> And a foreigner shall dwell in Ashdod,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And I will take away his blood out of his mouth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his abominations from between his teeth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But he who remains, even he, shall be for our God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall be as a governor in Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And I will encamp around my house because of the army,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of him who passes by,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and because of him who returns.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And no oppressor shall pass through them anymore.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For now I have seen with my eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, your King comes to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is just and having salvation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lowly and riding upon a donkey,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the horse from Jerusalem,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the battle-bow shall be cut off.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall speak peace to the heathen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And his dominion shall be from sea to sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> As for you also, by the blood of your covenant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have sent forth your prisoners out of the pit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which there is no water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Even today I declare that I will render double to you,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> When I have bent Judah for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />filled the bow with Ephraim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and raised up your sons, O Zion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against your sons, O Greece,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made you as the sword of a mighty man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And the LORD shall be seen over them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The LORD of hosts will defend them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall devour and subdue with sling-stones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall drink and make a noise as through wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altar.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And the LORD their God will save them in that day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the flock of his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall be as the stones of a crown,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> For how great his goodness is<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and how great his beauty is!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Grain shall make the young men cheerful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and new wine the virgins.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</p>
  <p>This chapter treats of the conversion of the Gentiles, before spoken of in general, now particularly named; of the coming of Christ into the world, and the advantages of it to his church; of the preaching of the Gospel by the apostles, and of their protection, encouragement, and success. The Gentiles converted are first the Syrians that dwelt in Hadrach, Damascus, and Hamath, the Lord's eye being upon them (verse 1); next the Phoenicians, the inhabitants of Tyre and Zidon, who had a vain opinion of their wisdom, and trusted in their riches (verses 2-4); and then the Philistines, the inhabitants of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Ashdod, guilty of pride, murder, idolatry, and other abominations (verses 5-7); when the church and people of God should be safely protected (verse 8); to whom, for their joy and comfort, is given forth a prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah; who is described by his character as a King, just, having salvation, lowly, and riding on a donkey; by the peaceableness of his kingdom; by the various offices he executes; the prophetic office, speaking peace to the Heathen; the kingly office, his dominion being very large; and his priestly office, in the effusion of his blood, by which the covenant is confirmed, his people delivered out of distress, and encouraged to flee to him as their stronghold, where they find plenty and protection (verses 9-12); next the apostles are represented as military men, accoutered with the bow and the sword of the mighty (verse 13); whose success is owing to the Lord's appearance over them, and the efficacy of his grace and Spirit attending the word (verse 14); who are protected and encouraged in it by the Lord, and honored on account of it (verses 15-16); and the chapter is concluded with an exclamation, wondering at the grace and glory of Christ, and expressing the satisfying provisions of his house (verse 17).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "though she is very wise" - A lot of translations have, "though they are very wise."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in Matthew 21:5; John 12:15.</p>
