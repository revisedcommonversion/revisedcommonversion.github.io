  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 [<span class="it">A burden.</span>] The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be its resting place (for the eyes of man and of all the tribes of Israel shall be toward the LORD),</p>

  <p>2 And also Hamath, which borders by it, and Tyre and Zidon, because they are very wise.</p>

  <p>3 And Tyre built herself a stronghold and amassed silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</p>

  <p>4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her and he will smite her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>

  <p>5 Ashkelon shall see it and fear. Gaza shall also see it and be very sorrowful. Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>

  <p>6 And a foreigner shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</p>

  <p>7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth. But he who remains, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p>

  <p>8 And I will encamp around my house because of the army, because of him who passes by, and because of him who returns. And no oppressor shall pass through them anymore. For now I have seen with my eyes.</p>

  <p>9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your King comes to you. He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon a donkey, even upon a colt, the foal of a donkey.</p>

  <p>10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the heathen. And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p>

  <p>11 As for you also, by the blood of your covenant I have sent forth your prisoners out of the pit in which there is no water.</p>

  <p>12 Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will render double to you,</p>

  <p>13 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you as the sword of a mighty man.</p>

  <p>14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning. And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet and will go with whirlwinds of the south.</p>

  <p>15 The LORD of hosts will defend them. They shall devour and subdue with sling-stones. They shall drink and make a noise as through wine. They shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altar.</p>

  <p>16 And the LORD their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people, for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</p>

  <p>17 For how great his goodness is and how great his beauty is! Grain shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</p>
  <p>This chapter treats of the conversion of the Gentiles, before spoken of in general, now particularly named; of the coming of Christ into the world, and the advantages of it to his church; of the preaching of the Gospel by the apostles, and of their protection, encouragement, and success. The Gentiles converted are first the Syrians that dwelt in Hadrach, Damascus, and Hamath, the Lord's eye being upon them (verse 1); next the Phoenicians, the inhabitants of Tyre and Zidon, who had a vain opinion of their wisdom, and trusted in their riches (verses 2-4); and then the Philistines, the inhabitants of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and Ashdod, guilty of pride, murder, idolatry, and other abominations (verses 5-7); when the church and people of God should be safely protected (verse 8); to whom, for their joy and comfort, is given forth a prophecy concerning the coming of the Messiah; who is described by his character as a King, just, having salvation, lowly, and riding on a donkey; by the peaceableness of his kingdom; by the various offices he executes; the prophetic office, speaking peace to the Heathen; the kingly office, his dominion being very large; and his priestly office, in the effusion of his blood, by which the covenant is confirmed, his people delivered out of distress, and encouraged to flee to him as their stronghold, where they find plenty and protection (verses 9-12); next the apostles are represented as military men, accoutered with the bow and the sword of the mighty (verse 13); whose success is owing to the Lord's appearance over them, and the efficacy of his grace and Spirit attending the word (verse 14); who are protected and encouraged in it by the Lord, and honored on account of it (verses 15-16); and the chapter is concluded with an exclamation, wondering at the grace and glory of Christ, and expressing the satisfying provisions of his house (verse 17).</p>
  <p>[v.2] - "though she is very wise" - A lot of translations have, "though they are very wise."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoted in Matthew 21:5; John 12:15.</p>
