  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 2 And the LORD said to Satan, "I, the LORD, rebuke you, O Satan. Even I, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you. Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?" 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel. 4 And he answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, "Take away the filthy garments from him." And he said to him, "Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with costly clothing." 5 And I said, "Let them set a fair miter upon his head." So they set a fair miter upon his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</p>

  <p>6 And the angel of the LORD protested to Joshua, saying, 7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: 'If you will walk in my ways and if you will keep my charge, then you shall also judge my house and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.</p>

  <p>8 'Hear now, O Joshua the high priest—you and your fellows who sit before you—for they are men wondered at. For behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 9 For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua, upon one stone shall be seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an engraving on it,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 10 In that day,' says the LORD of hosts, 'each of you shall call his neighbor under the vine and under the fig-tree.'"</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</p>
  <p>In this chapter, under the type of Joshua the high priest, is showed the state and condition of the priesthood, and of the church of God, in his times; and in it are various promises concerning the true High Priest, Christ, and of the efficacy and permanency of his priesthood. The vision of Joshua is in the form of a judicial process: Joshua is the person accused, and is described by his situation, standing before the Angel of the Lord; and by the filthy garments he had on, which were the ground of the charge against him (verses 1, 3); The accuser of him is Satan, who stood at his right hand; and his Judge is the Angel of the Lord, before whom he was (verse 1). The sentence given against his accuser is by way of rebuke, enforced by the Lord's choice of Jerusalem, and merciful deliverance of this person; and, as given in his favor, is an order to take his filthy garments from him, and clothe him with change of raiment, and to put a fair miter on his head; which were accordingly done (verses 2, 4, 5); and a promise is made him, by way of protestation, that if he would walk in his ways, and keep his charge, he should judge his house, and keep his courts, and should have a walking place among those who stood by (verses 6-7); and next, Joshua, and those who were with him, are addressed as men wondered at; and are called upon to listen to a promise of the Messiah, under the character of the Branch (verse 8); and under that of a stone with seven eyes on it, and engravings in it, by whom the iniquity of God's people is removed (verse 9); and the chapter is closed with an account of the prosperity, peace, and safety of the saints under the Gospel dispensation (verse 10).</p>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Prayer for Verses 2:11-3:4:</p>
  <p>Grant, Almighty God, that as you have made us a royal priesthood in your Son, that we may daily offer to you spiritual sacrifices, and be devoted to you, both in body and soul,— O grant, that we, being endued with your power, may boldly fight against Satan, and never doubt but that you will finally give us the victory, though we may have to undergo many troubles and difficulties: and may not the contempt of the world frighten or dishearten us, but may we patiently bear all our reproaches, until you at length stretch forth your hand to raise us up to that glory, the perfection of which now appears in our head, and shall at last be clearly seen in all the members, in the whole body, even when he shall come to gather us into that celestial kingdom, which he has purchased for us by his own blood. Amen.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Reference, Isaiah 11:1; Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15; Zechariah 6:12.</p>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Prayer for Verses 5-9:</p>
  <p>Grant, Almighty God, that as by nature we do not willingly submit to the reproach and contempt of the world,— O grant, that with our hearts lifted up to heaven, we may become indifferent to all reproaches, and that our faith may not succumb nor vacillate, though profane men may ridicule us while serving you under the cross: but may we patiently wait, until Christ shall at length appear in the splendor of his priesthood and kingdom; and may we, in the meantime, contemplate the excellency with which you have adorned your Church, and be thus encouraged to connect ourselves with those few and despised men, who faithfully and sincerely follow your word, and disregard the arrogance of the whole world, and never doubt, but that if we remain grounded in the pure doctrine of the gospel, you will raise us up to heaven, and even above all heavens, where we shall enjoy that blessedness which your only-begotten Son has obtained for us by his own blood. Amen.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - John Calvin's prayer for verse 10 is included with the first six verses of the next chapter. Therefore, the prayer is in the next chapter.</p>
