  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 2 Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what its breadth is and what its length is." 3 And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 4 And said to him, "Run, speak to this young man, saying, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it. 5 For I,' says the LORD, 'will be to her a wall of fire on every side and will be the glory in the midst of her.'"</p>

  <p>6 "Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north," says the LORD, "for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven," says the LORD. 7 "Deliver yourself, O Zion, who dwell with the daughter of Babylon." 8 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "After the glory he has sent me to the nations which wasted you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of his eye. 9 For behold, I will shake my hand upon them and they shall be a spoil to their servants. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For behold, I come and I will dwell in the midst of you," says the LORD. 11 "And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day and shall be my people. And I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose Jerusalem again.</p>

  <p>13 "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he is raised up out of his holy habitation."</p>

  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eRZF9HuVV_LNg6KcT0y2Jry_be5kp-6fl5Vk_Fa3TmQ" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Zechariah, Chapter 2</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</p>
  <p>This chapter contains a prophecy of the church under the Gospel dispensation; of the largeness and numbers of it; and of its protection and glory, through the presence of God in it. In this vision, a man is seen with a measuring line in his hand, to measure Jerusalem with (verses 1-2); upon which an angel bids the angel that talked with the prophet to declare to him the largeness, populousness, and safety of Jerusalem (verses 3-5); then follows an exhortation to the people of God to come out of Babylon (verses 6-7); and then a promise of the calling of the Gentiles, and of God's gracious inhabitation in his church, which would be a matter of joy to Zion; and of his inheriting Judah, and choosing Jerusalem (verses 8-12); and the chapter is concluded with an address to all mankind, to be silent before the Lord, since he was raised up out of his habitation (verse 13).</p>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Prayer for Verses 1:18-2:5:</p>
  <p>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are on every side surrounded by many enemies, and as Satan never ceases to kindle the fury of many, not only to be hostile to us, but also to destroy and consume us,— O grant that we may learn to raise up our eyes to heaven, and trusting in your protection may boldly fight in patience, until that shall appear which you have once testified in this remarkable prophesy, that there are many smiths in your hall, and many hammers, by which you break in pieces those horns which rise up to scatter us, and until at length, after having overcome all the devices of Satan, we shall reach that blessed rest which has been provided for us by the blood of your only-begotten Son. Amen.</p>
  <p class="bold">John Calvin's Prayer for Verses 6-10:</p>
  <p>Grant, Almighty God, that as you see that we continually tremble in the midst of dangers, and often stumble and fall through the infirmity of our flesh,— O grant, that we may learn so to rely on the strength and help which you promise to us, that we may not hesitate to pass through all kinds of dangers, and boldly and firmly to fight under your banner; and may we be thus gathered more and more into the unity of your Church, until having, finished all our troubles and contests, we shall at length reach that blessed and celestial rest which has been obtained for us by the blood of your only-begotten Son. Amen.</p>
  <p>[v.11-13] - John Calvin's prayer for verses 11-13 is included with the first three verses of the next chapter. Therefore, the prayer is in the next chapter.</p>
