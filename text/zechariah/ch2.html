  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 2 Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what its breadth is and what its length is." 3 And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 4 And said to him, "Run, speak to this young man, saying, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle in it. 5 For I,' says the LORD, 'will be to her a wall of fire on every side and will be the glory in the midst of her.'"</p>

  <p>6 "Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north," says the LORD, "for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven," says the LORD. 7 "Deliver yourself, O Zion, who dwell with the daughter of Babylon." 8 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "After the glory he has sent me to the nations which wasted you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of his eye. 9 For behold, I will shake my hand upon them and they shall be plunder to their servants. And you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For behold, I come and I will dwell in the midst of you," says the LORD. 11 "And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day and shall be my people. And I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose Jerusalem again.</p>

  <p>13 "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he is raised up out of his holy habitation."</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</p>
  <p>This chapter contains a prophecy of the church under the Gospel dispensation; of the largeness and numbers of it; and of its protection and glory, through the presence of God in it. In this vision, a man is seen with a measuring line in his hand, to measure Jerusalem with (verses 1-2); upon which an angel bids the angel that talked with the prophet to declare to him the largeness, populousness, and safety of Jerusalem (verses 3-5); then follows an exhortation to the people of God to come out of Babylon (verses 6-7); and then a promise of the calling of the Gentiles, and of God's gracious inhabitation in his church, which would be a matter of joy to Zion; and of his inheriting Judah, and choosing Jerusalem (verses 8-12); and the chapter is concluded with an address to all mankind, to be silent before the Lord, since he was raised up out of his habitation (verse 13).</p>
