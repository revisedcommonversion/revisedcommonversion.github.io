  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 God, who at many times and in diverse manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, 2 Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom he also made the universe. 3 He is the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself made purification of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high, 4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they have.</p>

  <p>5 For to which of the angels did he at any time say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>You are my Son.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This day I have begotten you,</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>and again,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
  <p class="in-verse">"<cite>I will be a Father to him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall be a Son to me</cite>"?</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 And again, when he brings the first-begotten into the world, he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>And let all the angels of God worship him.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 And of the angels he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>He makes his angels spirits,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his ministers a flame of fire.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 But to the Son, he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> <cite>You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, God, even your God, has anointed you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the oil of gladness above your fellows.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 And,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>You, Lord, in the beginning have laid the foundation of the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heavens are the works of your hands.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> <cite>They shall perish, but you remain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they all shall become old as a garment does.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> <cite>And as a vesture you will fold them up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall be changed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you are the same,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your years shall not fail.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 But to which of the angels did he at any time say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>Sit on my right hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet</cite>"?</p>
  </div>

  <p>14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall inherit salvation?</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/hebrews/MHC%20-%20Hebrews%2C%20Chapter%2001.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Hebrews, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2a] - "spoken to us by his Son" - Christ was the Word of God and God Himself. When Christ spoke, God was speaking (John 1:1, 14). Also note from Matthew 1:23 that Emmanuel means, "God with us."</p>
  <p>[v.2b] - "universe" - From the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary: "Literally, 'ages' with all things and persons belonging to them; the universe, including all space and ages of time, and all material and spiritual existences."</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high" - Reference, Mark 16:19.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Quoting 2nd Samuel 7:14 (LXX) and Psalm 2:7 (LXX). See also, 1st Chronicles 17:13.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoting either Deuteronomy 32:43 (LXX) or Psalm 97:7 (LXX—paraphrased), but Deuteronomy is most likely being quoted. From John Calvin's Commentary: "The Hebrew word [in Psalm 97:7], rendered angels, is Elohim—gods; but there is no doubt but that the Prophet speaks of angels; for the meaning is, that there is no power so high but must be in subjection to the authority of this king, whose advent was to cause joy to the whole world."</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Quoting Psalm 104:4 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoting Psalm 45:6 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoting Psalm 45:7 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoting Psalm 102:25 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoting Psalm 102:26 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Quoting Psalm 102:26-27 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.13] - Quoting Psalm 110:1 (LXX).</p>
