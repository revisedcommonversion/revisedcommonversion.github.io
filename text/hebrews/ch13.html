  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Let brotherly love continue. 2 Do not be forgetful to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels unintentionally. 3 Remember those who are in bonds, as bound with them, and those who suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled, but God will judge lewd persons and adulterers. 5 Let your manner of life be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have, for he has said, "<cite>I will never leave you, nor forsake you,</cite>" 6 So that we may boldly say,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>The Lord is my helper,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will not fear<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />what man shall do to me.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 Remember your leaders, who spoke to you the word of God. Follow their faith, considering the end of their manner of life. 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 9 Do not be carried away with diverse and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart is established with grace, not with foods, which have not profited those who have been occupied in them. 10 We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle. 11 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp. 12 Therefore, Jesus also, so that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate. 13 Let us go forth therefore to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach. 14 For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p>

  <p>15 Therefore, by him, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name. 16 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>

  <p>17 Obey your leaders and submit yourselves, for they watch for your souls as those who must give account, so that they may do it with joy and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.</p>

  <p>18 Pray for us, for we trust we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things. 19 But I implore you the rather to do this so that I may be restored to you more quickly.</p>

  <p>20 Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 21 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>

  <p>22 And I implore you, brothers, bear with the word of exhortation, for I have written a letter to you in few words. 23 Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you. 24 Salute all of your leaders and all the saints. Those of Italy salute you.</p>

  <p>25 May grace be with you all. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/hebrews/MHC%20-%20Hebrews%2C%20Chapter%2013.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Hebrews, Chapter 13</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2] - "entertained" - That is, to receive as a guest, to entertain hospitably.</p>
  <p>[v.5a] - Reference, Philippians 4:11.</p>
  <p>[v.5b] - Quoting Joshua 1:5. Reference, Deuteronomy 31:6, 8.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoting Psalm 118:6 (LXX). See also, Psalm 56:4. This passage quoted here is rendered differently in this Old Testament than the LXX, as it presents the final line as a question, as in, "The LORD is on my side. I will not fear. What can man do to me?"</p>
  <p>[v.7] - A literal rendering of the beginning of this verse would be, "Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the word of God." The change in the RCV from the WBS/KJV makes this passage read in the past tense, which better follows the Greek, "for the reference is to departed chiefs" (Pulpit Commentary), or leaders, who "'spoke' (so the Greek aorist means) during their lifetime. This Epistle was among those written later, when many of the heads of the Jerusalem Church had passed away" (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown).</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Reference, Malachi 3:6.</p>
  <p>[v.16] - "share" - In other words, "Impart a share of your means to the needy" (Jamieson-Fausset-Brown).</p>
  <p>[v.20] - "that great Shepherd of the sheep" - Reference, John 10:11-18.</p>
