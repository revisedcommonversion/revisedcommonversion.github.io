    <p class="ch-outline">The weakness of the law sacrifices, 1-9. The sacrifice of Christ's body once offered, 10-13, forever has taken away sins, 14-18. An exhortation to hold firmly to the faith with patience and thanksgiving, 19-39.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 For the law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually, make perfect those who draw near. 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins. 3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. 4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</p>

  <p>5 Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you have prepared me a body.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> <cite>In burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> <cite>Then I said, 'Behold, I come<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(in the volume of the book it is written concerning me)<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to do your will, O God.'</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 Above, when he said, "'<cite>Sacrifice and offering,</cite>' and '<cite>burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin you did not desire, neither had pleasure in them</cite>'"—which are offered by the law— 9 Then he said, "<cite>Behold, I come to do your will, O God.</cite>" He takes away the first so that he may establish the second, 10 By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

  <p>11 And every priest stands daily ministering and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 12 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, "<cite>sat down on the right hand</cite>" of God, 13 From now on waiting "<cite>until his enemies are made his footstool for his feet.</cite>" 14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. 15 Of this the Holy Spirit is also a witness to us. For after that, he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> "<cite>'This is the covenant<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that I will make with them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />after those days,' says the Lord,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I will put my laws into their hearts,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in their minds I will write them,</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> <cite>'And their sins and iniquities<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will no longer remember.'</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 Now where remission of these is, there is no longer any offering for sin.</p>

  <p>19 Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, 20 By a new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, 21 And having a high priest over the house of God, 22 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold firmly to the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful who promised. 24 And let us consider one another to excite to love and to good works, 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</p>

  <p>26 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains sacrifice for sins, 27 But a certain fearful apprehension of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 28 He who despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe a punishment do you suppose he shall be thought worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God, has counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified an unholy thing, and has done an indignity to the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know him who has said, "<cite>Vengeance belongs to me. I will recompense,</cite>" says the Lord. And again, "<cite>The Lord will judge his people.</cite>" 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>

  <p>32 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions, 33 Partly while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, and partly while you became companions of those who were thus used. 34 For you had compassion on me in my bonds and joyfully took the seizing of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance. 35 Therefore, do not cast away your confidence, which has great recompense of reward. 36 For you have need of patience so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> For yet a little while,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"<cite>and he who is coming will come and will not delay.</cite></p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> <cite>Now the just shall live by faith.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But if any man draws back,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>39 But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.</p>
