  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 2 For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, 3 How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? It was spoken at the first by the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, 4 God also bearing them testimony, both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.</p>

  <p>5 For to the angels he has not put in subjection the world to come, concerning which we speak.</p>

  <p>6 But someone in a certain place testified, saying, "<cite>What is man that you are mindful of him, or the son of man that you visit him?</cite></p>

  <p>7 <cite>You made him a little lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor and set him over the works of your hands.</cite></p>

  <p>8 <cite>You have put all things in subjection under his feet.</cite>" For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not made subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him.</p>

  <p>9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.</p>

  <p>10 For it was fitting for him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 11 For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</p>

  <p>12 Saying, "<cite>I will declare your name to my brothers. In the midst of the church I will sing praise to you.</cite>"</p>

  <p>13 And again, "<cite>I will put my trust in him.</cite>" And again, "<cite>Behold, I and the children which God has given me.</cite>"</p>

  <p>14 Since then the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, so that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, 15 And deliver those who through fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage. 16 For truly he does not give help to angels, but he gives help to the offspring of Abraham. 17 Therefore, in all things it behooved him to be made like his brothers so that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 18 For in that he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/hebrews/MHC%20-%20Hebrews%2C%20Chapter%2002.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Hebrews, Chapter 2</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.6-8] - Quoting Psalm 8:4-6 (LXX). Reference, Job 7:17; Psalm 144:3.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "all from one" - From John Gill's Exposition: "They are both of one God and Father, Christ's God is their God, and his Father is their Father; they are of one body, Christ is the head, and they are members; they are of one covenant, Christ is the surety, Mediator, and messenger of it, and they share in all its blessings and promises; they are of one man, Adam, Christ is a Son of Adam, though not by ordinary generation, they descend from him in the common way; they are all of one nature, of one blood; Christ has took part of the same flesh and blood with them."</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Quoting Psalm 22:22 (LXX—paraphrased).</p>
  <p>[v.13a] - Quoting Isaiah 8:17-18 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.13b] - The quotation from Isaiah is a sentence fragment and should be written like this: "Behold, I and the children which God has given me..." Note the "..." as the ending punctuation to indicate that there's more to the passage than what is given.</p>
