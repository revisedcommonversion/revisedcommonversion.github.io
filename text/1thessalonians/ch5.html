  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you. 2 For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes even as a thief in the night. 3 For when they say, "Peace and safety," then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. 4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that the day should overtake you as a thief. 5 You are all children of light and children of the day. We are not of the night, nor of darkness. 6 Therefore, let us not sleep as others do, but let us watch and be sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night. 8 But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breast-plate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 9 For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 Who died for us, so that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 11 Therefore, comfort yourselves together and edify one another, even as you also do.</p>
  
  <p>12 And we implore you, brothers, to regard those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. 14 Now we exhort you, brothers, warn those who are disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, and be patient toward all men. 15 See that no one renders evil for evil to any man, but always follow that which is good, both among yourselves and to all men. 16 Rejoice evermore. 17 Pray without ceasing. 18 In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophesyings. 21 Prove all things. Hold firmly to that which is good. 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
  
  <p>23 And may the very God of peace sanctify you wholly. And may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 Faithful is he who calls you, who also will do it.</p>
  
  <p>25 Brothers, pray for us.</p>
  
  <p>26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 27 I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brothers.</p>
  
  <p>28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
