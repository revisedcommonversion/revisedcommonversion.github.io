    <p class="ch-outline">Of the duty of servants, 1, 2. Not to have fellowship with newfangled teachers, 3-5. Godliness is great gain, 6-9; and love of money the root of all evil, 10.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor so that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed. 2 And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. Teach and exhort these things.</p>

  <p>3 If any man teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrine which is according to godliness, 4 He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 5 Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness. Withdraw yourself from such. 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. 8 And having food and clothing, with these let us be content. 9 But those who wish to be rich fall into temptation, a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. 10 For the love of money is the root of all evil, which, while some have coveted, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>

  <p>11 But you, O man of God, flee from these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. 12 Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of eternal life to which you are also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses. 13 I give you charge in the sight of God, who makes all things alive, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified a good confession, 14 That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 Which in his times he will show who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, 16 Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.</p>

  <p>17 Charge those who are rich in this world, that they not be high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. 18 Charge them to do good and that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, 19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, so that they may take hold of eternal life.</p>

  <p>20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 Which some, professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
