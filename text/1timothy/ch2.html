    <p class="ch-outline">Paul gives direction to pray and give thanks for all men, and the reason why, 1-7. The duties of men and women respectively concerning public prayer, 8-10.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, 2 For kings, and for all who are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 4 Who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all—the testimony in its own due times, 7 For which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, and do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>

  <p>8 I wish therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>

  <p>9 In like manner also, [I wish] that women adorn themselves in decent apparel with modesty and sobriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly array, 10 But (which is proper for women professing godliness) with good works. 11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 12 But I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression. 15 But she will be saved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, charity, and holiness, with sobriety.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/1-timothy/MHC%20-%201st%20Timothy%2C%20Chapter%202.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - 1st Timothy, Chapter 2</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.1-2] - Reference, Romans 13:1; Titus 3:1; 1st Peter 2:13.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - There are various renderings of this verse. One such rendering is that of the ASV: "For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus." Another way to word this verse following the Greek text is this: "For one God, one mediator also of God and of men, a man, Christ Jesus." From the Pulpit Commentary: "The human nature of our Lord is here insisted upon, to show how fit he is to mediate for man, as his Godhead fits him to mediate with God."</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "the testimony in its own due times" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "This phrase is somewhat obscure, and is differently explained. But the most literal rendering and the best sense seems to be: 'The testimony, at its proper time, to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle,' meaning that the mediation and redemption of Jesus Christ was the subject-matter of that testimony which he, Paul, was appointed to bear at the proper time."</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Text in square brackets added for implied meaning. Implied from the structure of verse 8.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - See comments for 1st Corinthians 14:34.</p>
