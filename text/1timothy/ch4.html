  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, 3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused, if received with thanksgiving, 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>

  <p>6 If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which you have attained. 7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise yourself rather to godliness. 8 For bodily exercise profits little, but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. 9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 10 For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.</p>

  <p>11 These things command and teach. 12 Let no man despise your youth, but be an example of the believers in word, in deportment, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity. 13 Until I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine. 14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 15 Meditate upon these things. Give yourself wholly to them so that your profiting may appear to all. 16 Take heed to yourself and to your doctrine. Continue in them. For in doing this you will both save yourself and those who hear you.</p>
