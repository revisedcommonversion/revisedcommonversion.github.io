  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, so that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing, saying,</p>

  <p>2 "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: 'The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 3 Who is there among you of all his people? May his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel (he is the God), who is in Jerusalem. 4 And whoever remains in any place where he sojourns, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, besides the voluntary-offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.'"</p>

  <p>5 Then arose the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites, with all whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. 6 And all those who were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered. 7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods, 8 Even those Cyrus king of Persia brought forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 9 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, one thousand chargers of silver, twenty-nine knives, 10 Thirty basins of gold, four hundred and ten silver basins of a second sort, and one thousand other vessels. 11 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought with those of the captivity who were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>
