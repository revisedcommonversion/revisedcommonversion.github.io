  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem. The rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities. 2 And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>3 Now these are the chief of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his possession in their cities, namely, Israel, the priests, the Levites, the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants. 4 And some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin dwelt at Jerusalem. Of the children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez; 5 And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni. 6 All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.</p>

  <p>7 And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah; 8 And after him, Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. 9 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer. And Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.</p>

  <p>10 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin, 11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God. 12 And their brothers who performed the work of the house numbered eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchiah, 13 And his brothers, chief of the fathers, two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, 14 And their brothers, mighty men of valor, one hundred twenty-eight. And their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men.</p>

  <p>15 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 16 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward business of the house of God; 17 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer, and Bakbukiah the second among his brothers; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 18 All the Levites in the holy city numbered two hundred and eighty-four.</p>

  <p>19 Moreover, the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers who kept the gates numbered one hundred and seventy-two.</p>

  <p>20 And the residue of Israel, of the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah each in his inheritance. 21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.</p>

  <p>22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business of the house of God. 23 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day. 24 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people.</p>

  <p>25 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath-arba and in its villages, at Dibon and in its villages, at Jekabzeel and in its villages, 26 At Jeshua, at Moladah, at Beth-phelet, 27 At Hazar-shual, at Beer-sheba and in its villages, 28 At Ziklag, at Mekonah and in its villages, 29 At En-rimmon, at Zareah, at Jarmuth, 30 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish and its fields, and at Azekah and in its villages. And they dwelt from Beer-sheba to the valley of Hinnom. 31 The children of Benjamin also dwelt from Geba, at Michmash, Aija, and Beth-el, and in their villages, 32 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, 34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen. 36 And of the Levites some divisions in Judah were joined to Benjamin.</p>
