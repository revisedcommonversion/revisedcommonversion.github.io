  <p>1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed, 2 That I gave my brother Hanani and Hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man and feared God above many. 3 And I said to them, "Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot. And while they stand by, let them shut the doors and bar them. And appoint watches from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his watch and each to be over against his house." 4 Now the city was large and great, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built.</p>

  <p>5 And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the rulers, and the people, so that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and found this written in it:</p>

  <p>6 These are the children of the province who went up out of the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city, 7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel was this: 8 The children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two; 9 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two; 10 The children of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two; 11 The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and eighteen; 12 The children of Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; 13 The children of Zattu, eight hundred and forty five; 14 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty; 15 The children of Binnui, six hundred and forty-eight; 16 The children of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-eight; 17 The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred and twenty-two; 18 The children of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-seven; 19 The children of Bigvai, two thousand and sixty-seven; 20 The children of Adin, six hundred and fifty-five; 21 The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety-eight; 22 The children of Hashum, three hundred and twenty-eight; 23 The children of Bezai, three hundred and twenty-four; 24 The children of Hariph, one hundred and twelve; 25 The children of Gibeon, ninety-five; 26 The men of Beth-lehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight; 27 The men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight; 28 The men of Beth-azmaveth, forty-two; 29 The men of Kirjath-jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three; 30 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred and twenty-one; 31 The men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two; 32 The men of Beth-el and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three; 33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty-two; 34 The children of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; 35 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty; 36 The children of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five; 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one; 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.</p>

  <p>39 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three; 40 The children of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two; 41 The children of Pashur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven; 42 The children of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.</p>

  <p>43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah, seventy-four. 44 The singers: the children of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight. 45 The gatekeepers: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, and the children of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.</p>

  <p>46 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth, 47 The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon, 48 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Shalmai, 49 The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, 50 The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, 51 The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah, 52 The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim, 53 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur, 54 The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha, 55 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Tamah, 56 The children of Neziah, and the children of Hatipha.</p>

  <p>57 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 58 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 59 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, and the children of Amon.</p>

  <p>60 All the Nethinims and the children of Solomon's servants were three hundred and ninety-two.</p>

  <p>61 And these were those who went up also from Tel-mela, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not show their fathers' house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, and the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two. 63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, and the children of Barzillai, who took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite for a wife and was called after their name. 64 These sought their register among those who were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found. Therefore, they were deemed polluted and taken from the priesthood. 65 And the Tirshatha said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things, until there should stand up a priest with Urim and Thummim.</p>

  <p>66 The whole congregation together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, 67 Besides their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. And they had two hundred and forty five singing-men and singing-women. 68 Their horses, seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules, two hundred and forty-five; 69 Their camels, four hundred and thirty-five; and their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.</p>

  <p>70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure one thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred minas of silver. 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, two thousand minas of silver, and sixty-seven priests' garments.</p>

  <p>73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the Nethinims, and all Israel dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.</p>
