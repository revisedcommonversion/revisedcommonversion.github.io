  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting and with sackcloth and earth upon them. 2 And the offspring of Israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. 3 And they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God for one fourth part of the day, and for another fourth part they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God. 4 Then, of the Levites, Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood upon the stairs and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.</p>

  <p>5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, "Stand up and bless the LORD your God forever and ever:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">Blessed be your glorious name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which is exalted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />above all blessing and praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> You are Yahweh, even you alone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have made heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the heaven of heavens with all their host,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth and all things that are in it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the seas and all that is in them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you preserve them all.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the host of heaven worships you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> You are the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the God who chose Abram,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />brought him forth from Ur of the Chaldeans,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave him the name of Abraham,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And found his heart faithful before you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and made a covenant with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Amorites, the Perizzites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the Jebusites, and the Girgashites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to give it to his offspring,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have performed your words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are righteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and heard their cry by the Red Sea,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you knew that they dealt proudly against them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus you made yourself a name,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as it is this day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And you divided the sea before them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you threw their persecutors into the depths,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a stone into the mighty waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Moreover, you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the night by a pillar of fire,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to give them light in the way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in which they should go.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> You came down also upon mount Sinai,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />spoke with them from heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave them right judgments, true laws,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />good statutes, and commandments,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> And made your holy sabbath known to them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the hand of Moses your servant,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And gave them bread from heaven for their hunger<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and promised them that they should go in to possess the land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you had sworn to give them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not listen to your commandments.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And they refused to obey, neither were they mindful<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of your wonders that you performed among them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to return to their bondage.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But you are a God ready to pardon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />gracious and merciful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />slow to anger, and of great kindness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not forsake them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Indeed, when they had made themselves<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a molten calf, and said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'This is your God who brought you out of Egypt,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and had wrought great provocations,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Yet you in your manifold mercies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />did not forsake them in the wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to lead them in the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the way in which they should go.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> You also gave your good Spirit to instruct them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You did not withhold your manna from their mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you gave them water for their thirst.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Indeed, for forty years you sustained them in the wilderness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />sand they lacked nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their clothes did not grow old<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their feet did not swell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Moreover, you gave them kingdoms and nations<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and divided them into corners.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus they possessed the land of Sihon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the land of the king of Heshbon,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the land of Og king of Bashan.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Their children you also multiplied<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the stars of heaven<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brought them into the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />concerning which you had promised to their fathers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that they should go in to possess it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Thus the children went in and possessed the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they might do with them as they wished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> And they took strong cities and a fat land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and possessed houses full of all goods,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />wells dug, vineyards and olive-groves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fruit trees in abundance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Thus they ate and were filled<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and became fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they cast your law behind their backs<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and slew your prophets who testified against them to turn them to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they wrought great provocations.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Therefore, you delivered them into the hand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of their enemies who distressed them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you heard them from heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And according to your manifold mercies you gave them deliverers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> But after they had rest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they did evil again before you;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, you left them in the hand of their enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they had the dominion over them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet when they returned and cried to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you heard them from heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and many times you delivered them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to your mercies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> You testified against them so that you might bring them back to your law.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet they dealt proudly and did not listen to your commandments,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but sinned against your judgments<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />(which if a man does, he shall live in them),<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />withdrew the shoulder,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Yet many years you forbore over them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and testified against them by your Spirit in your prophets.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Yet they would not give ear.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Therefore, you gave them into the hand of the people of the lands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Nevertheless, for your great mercies' sake<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you did not utterly consume them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor forsake them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you are a gracious and merciful God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and mercy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not let all the trouble seem little before you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that has come upon us,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on our kings, on our princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on our priests, on our prophets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on our fathers, and on all your people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> But you are just in all that is brought upon us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For you have done right,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but we have done wickedly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Neither our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />have kept your law<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with which you testified against them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> For they have not served you in their kingdom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in your great goodness that you gave them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the large and fat land which you gave before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither did they turn from their wicked works.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> Behold, we are servants this day,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the land that you gave to our fathers<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to eat its fruit and its good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />behold, we are servants in it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> And it yields much increase to the kings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom you have set over us because of our sins.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They also have dominion over our bodies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and over our cattle at their pleasure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and we are in great distress.</p>
  </div>

  <p>38 And because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it. And our princes, Levites, and priests set their seals to it."</p>
