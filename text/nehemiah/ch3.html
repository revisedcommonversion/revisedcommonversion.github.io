  <p>1 Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep-gate. They sanctified it and set up its doors. Even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel. 2 And next to him the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.</p>

  <p>3 But the fish-gate was built by the sons of Hassenaah, who also laid its beams, set up its doors, its locks, and its bars. 4 And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, repaired. And next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel, repaired. And next to them Zadok the son of Baana repaired. 5 And next to them the Tekoites repaired, but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.</p>

  <p>6 Moreover, the old gate was repaired by Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams, set up its doors, its locks, and its bars. 7 And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, repaired to the throne of the governor on this side of the river. 8 Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths, repaired.

  <p>15 But the gate of the fountain was repaired by Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah. He built it, covered it, set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David. 16 After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, repaired to the place over against the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty. 17 After him the Levites repaired: Rehum the son of Bani. Next to him Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, repaired in his part. 18 After him their brothers, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, repaired. 19 And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another piece over against the ascent to the armory, at the turning of the wall. 20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 21 After him Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, repaired another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib, even to the end of the house of Eliashib. 22 And after him the priests, the men of the plain, repaired. 23 After him Benjamin and Hashub repaired over against their house. After him Azariah the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, repaired by his house. 24 After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner. 25 Palal the son of Uzai repaired over against the turning of the wall and the tower which lies out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison, and after him Pedaiah the son of Parosh; 26 Moreover, the Nethinims dwelling in Ophel, to the place over against the water-gate toward the east and the projecting tower. 27 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece over against the great projecting tower, even to the wall of Ophel.</p>

  <p>28 From above the horse-gate the priests repaired, each over against his house. 29 After them Zadok the son of Immer repaired over against his house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate, repaired. 30 After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph repaired another piece.
