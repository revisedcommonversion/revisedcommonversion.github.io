  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 My little children, these things I write to you so that you do not sin. And if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</p>

  <p>3 And by this we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. 4 He who says, "I know him," and does not keep his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps his word, the love of God is truly perfected in him. By this we know that we are in him. 6 He who says he abides in him, ought himself also to walk even as he walked.</p>

  <p>7 Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is past and the true light now shines. 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness even until now. 10 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he who hates his brother is in darkness, walks in darkness, and does not know where he goes because darkness has blinded his eyes.</p>

  <p>12 I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</p>

  <p>15 Do not love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world and its lust passes away, but he who does the will of God abides forever.</p>

  <p>18 Little children, it is the last time. And as you have heard that the antichrist comes, even now there are many antichrists, by which we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out so that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But you have an unction from the Holy One and you know all things. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it and because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. But he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also shall continue in the Son and in the Father.</p>

  <p>25 And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.</p>

  <p>26 These things I have written to you concerning those who seduce you. 27 But the anointing which you have received from him abides in you, and you do not need that any man should teach you. But as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things and is truth and no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.</p>

  <p>28 And now, little children, abide in him so that when he appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does righteousness is born of him.</p>
