  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/amos/MHC%20-%20Amos%2C%20Chapter%204.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Amos, Chapter 4</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter, the great ones, or the people of Israel, are threatened with calamities for their oppression of the poor (verses 1-3); and in an ironic manner are reproved for their idolatry (verses 4-5); then follows an enumeration of several judgments that had been upon them, yet had no effect on them, to bring them to repentance, nor even mercies (verses 6-11); and notwithstanding all this, in a wonderful gracious manner, they are called upon to prepare to meet their God, who is described by his power, greatness, and goodness (verses 12-13).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - In this verse, the Israelites are being accused of being fat heifers, that is, they have grown fat with their riches, and so much that they feel themselves safe from any dangers, especially from God's judgments.</p>
  <p>[v.2a] - "holiness" - Though this is translated as holiness, it can also be translated as sanctuary. Therefore, the beginning of this verse can also be read as, "The Lord GOD has sworn by his sanctuary..." From John Calvin's Commentary: "God, by swearing by his sanctuary, repudiated all the fictitious forms of worship in which the Israelites gloried, as we have already seen."</p>
  <p>[v.2b] - "he will take you away with hooks" - In verse 1, the Israelites were accused of being fat heifers, having a false sense of security in their wealth. In this verse, they are threatened with being taken away with hooks. The idea here is that, despite their opulence, God would pluck them away as a small fish on a hook. They trusted in their fatness (i.e., their wealth), but God would carry them off as if they were of little weight.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - From the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge: "A bitter irony and sarcasm, addressed to the idolatrous Israelites."</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "cleanness of teeth" - That is, to be in want, or to experience famine.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "cutting-locust" - This is a type of locust that sheers or crops off the fruits and leaves of trees.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah" - Reference, Genesis 19:24-25.</p>
  <p>[v.13a] - From the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge: "This is a most powerful description of the majesty of Yahweh, the God of hosts." Reference Job 38:4-11.</p>
  <p>[v.13b] - Reference, Psalm 65:6, 135:7, 139:2, 147:18; Isaiah 40:12; Jeremiah 10:13, 13:16, 51:16; Micah 1:3; Zechariah 12:1; John 2:25; Hebrews 4:12.</p>
  <p>[v.13c] - "creates the wind" - This may also be read as, "creates the soul of man."</p>
  <p>[v.13d] - "makes the morning darkness" - This may also be read as, "makes the morning and the darkness."</p>
