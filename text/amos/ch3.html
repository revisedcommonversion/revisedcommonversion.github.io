  <p>1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which he brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "I have only known you of all the families of the earth;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Can two walk together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />unless they have agreed?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Will a lion roar in the forest<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he has no prey?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Will a young lion cry out of his den<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if he has taken nothing?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Can a bird fall in a trap upon the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />where no snare is for him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall one take up a trap from the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have taken nothing at all?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Shall a trumpet be blown in the city<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the people not be afraid?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Shall there be evil in a city<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD has not done it?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The lion has roared.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who will not fear?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The Lord GOD has spoken.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who can but prophesy?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Publish in the palaces at Ashdod<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say, "Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and behold the great tumults in the midst of it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the oppressed in the midst of it."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "For they do not know to do right,"</p>

  <p>says the LORD,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"who store up violence and robbery in their palaces."</p>

  <p>11 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"There shall even be an adversary around the land, and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be plundered."</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />two legs, or a piece of an ear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so the children of Israel shall be rescued who dwell in Samaria<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on the corner of a bed and in Damascus on a couch.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Hear, and testify in the house of Jacob,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel upon him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also visit the altars of Beth-el.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And the horns of the altar shall be cut off<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fall to the ground.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet goes on with his prophecy against Israel, whom God had highly favored, and yet sinned against him, and therefore must expect to be punished by him; and the rather, since he and they were not in agreement; and therefore there could be no communion between them (verses 1-3); and by various similes are set forth the cause of divine judgments, the certain design of them, and their continuance, until the end is answered; which should be attended to, since everything of this kind is of God, who, giving his prophets notice of it, they are under an absolute necessity of declaring it; nor should they be blamed for it (verses 4-8); and even the Heathen nations are appealed to as witnesses of the sins of Israel, that caused such a denunciation of wrath; their tumults, oppression, injustice, violence, and robbery (verses 9-10); therefore an adversary is threatened to be sent among them, that should utterly destroy them, so that few should escape (verses 11-12); particularly their idolatry and luxury seem to have been reigning sins, which had a great hand in bringing on their ruin, and for which the Lord would punish them (verses 13-15).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - Reference, 1st Corinthians 6:14-16.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, Hosea 11:10; Amos 1:2, 3:8.</p>
  <p>[v.5a] - "snare" - That is, a lure or bait.</p>
  <p>[v.5b] - Reference, Ecclesiastes 9:12; Daniel 9:14.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?" - In other words, "No calamity happens, except through God." Reference, Isaiah 45:7.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Reference, Psalm 25:14; Daniel 2:47; John 15:15; Revelation 10:7.</p>
