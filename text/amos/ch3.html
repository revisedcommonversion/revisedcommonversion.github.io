  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which he brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>

  <p>2 "I have only known you of all the families of the earth; therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities."</p>

  <p>3 Can two walk together unless they have agreed?</p>

  <p>4 Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he has taken nothing?</p>

  <p>5 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him? Shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all?</p>

  <p>6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city and the LORD has not done it?</p>

  <p>7 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.</p>

  <p>8 The lion has roared. Who will not fear? The Lord GOD has spoken. Who can but prophesy?</p>

  <p>9 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, "Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst of it and the oppressed in the midst of it." 10 "For they do not know to do right," says the LORD, "who store up violence and robbery in their palaces."</p>

  <p>11 Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD: "There shall even be an adversary around the land, and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be plundered."</p>

  <p>12 Thus says the LORD: "As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so the children of Israel shall be rescued who dwell in Samaria on the corner of a bed and in Damascus on a couch.</p>

  <p>13 Hear, and testify in the house of Jacob," says the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</p>

  <p>14 "For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el. And the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>15 And I will smite the winter-house together with the summer-house, the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end," says the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet goes on with his prophecy against Israel, whom God had highly favored, and yet sinned against him, and therefore must expect to be punished by him; and the rather, since he and they were not in agreement; and therefore there could be no communion between them (verses 1-3); and by various similes are set forth the cause of divine judgments, the certain design of them, and their continuance, until the end is answered; which should be attended to, since everything of this kind is of God, who, giving his prophets notice of it, they are under an absolute necessity of declaring it; nor should they be blamed for it (verses 4-8); and even the Heathen nations are appealed to as witnesses of the sins of Israel, that caused such a denunciation of wrath; their tumults, oppression, injustice, violence, and robbery (verses 9-10); therefore an adversary is threatened to be sent among them, that should utterly destroy them, so that few should escape (verses 11-12); particularly their idolatry and luxury seem to have been reigning sins, which had a great hand in bringing on their ruin, and for which the Lord would punish them (verses 13-15).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - Reference, 1st Corinthians 6:14-16.</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, Hosea 11:10; Amos 1:2, 3:8.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Reference, Ecclesiastes 9:12; Daniel 9:14.</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "Shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?" - In other words, "No calamity happens, except through God." Reference, Isaiah 45:7.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Reference, Psalm 25:14; Daniel 2:47; John 15:15; Revelation 10:7.</p>
