  <p>1 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not turn away his punishment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because he burned the bones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of the king of Edom into lime.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> But I will send a fire upon Moab,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And Moab shall die with tumult,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> And I will cut off the judge from the midst of it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will slay all its princes with him,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the LORD.</p>

  <p>4 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not turn away their punishment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they have despised the law of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have not kept his commandments.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their lies caused them to err,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />after which their fathers have walked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> But I will send a fire upon Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem."</p>
  </div>

  <p>6 Thus says the LORD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not turn away their punishment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they sold the righteous for silver<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the poor for a pair of shoes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> They pant after the dust of the earth<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />on the head of the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and turn aside the way of the meek.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And a man and his father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will go in to the same woman<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to profane my holy name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> And they lay themselves down<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they drink the wine of the condemned<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the house of their god.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whose height was like the height of the cedars<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he was strong as the oaks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet I destroyed his fruit from above<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his roots from beneath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Also I brought you from the land of Egypt<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and led you forty years through the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> And I raised up some of your sons for prophets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and some of your young men for Nazarites.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is it not even so, O children of Israel?"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the LORD.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> "But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and commanded the prophets, saying, 'Do not prophesy.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Behold, I am pressed under you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Therefore, the flight shall perish from the swift<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the strong shall not strengthen his force,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Neither shall he stand who handles the bow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who is swift of foot shall not deliver himself;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> And he who is courageous among the mighty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall flee away naked in that day,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet foretells the calamities that should come upon the Moabites for their transgressions (verses 1-3); and the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem for their iniquities (verses 4-5); also the judgments of God that should come upon Israel, the ten tribes, for their sins, which sins are enumerated; their oppression of the poor, their lewdness and idolatry (verses 6-8); and which are aggravated by the blessings of goodness bestowed upon them, both temporal and spiritual (verses 9-12); therefore they are threatened with ruin, which would be inevitable, notwithstanding their swiftness, strength, and courage, and their skill in shooting arrows, and riding horses (verses 13-16).</p>
  <p>[v.1] - "lime" - This may be read as "ashes."</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, Ezekiel 20:18-20; Acts 7:51.</p>
