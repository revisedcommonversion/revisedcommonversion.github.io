  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/amos/MHC%20-%20Amos%2C%20Chapter%206.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Amos, Chapter 6</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter seems to be directed both to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the ten tribes of Israel, under the names of Zion and Samaria, and to the principal men in both; who are reproved and threatened for their carnal security and self-confidence, being in no fear of the evil day, though they had no reason for it no more than other people (verses 1-3); are charged with wantonness, luxury, intemperance, and lack of sympathy with those in distress (verses 4-6); therefore are threatened to be carried captive first, and their city to be delivered up; which, for the certainty of it, is not only said, but swore to (verses 7-8); and a great mortality in every house, and the destruction of all houses, both great and small (verses 9-11); and since a reformation of them seemed impracticable, and not to be expected, but they gloried in their wealth, and boasted of their strength, therefore they should be afflicted by a foreign nation raised against them, which affliction should be general, from one end of the country to the other (verses 12-14).</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "and cause the seat of violence to come near" - This can also be read as, "and draw near the throne of iniquity." From John Calvin's Commentary: "When therefore [the judges] thus hardened themselves in all kinds of licentiousness, they then drew near the throne of iniquity. And they put away the evil day, because they were touched by no alarm; for when the Prophets denounced God's vengeance, they regarded it as a fable."</p>
  <p>[v.4] - "stall" - Or, fold (i.e., a pen or enclosure for sheep).</p>
  <p>[v.5] - This verse is in no way condemning the enjoyment of music, nor David's use of music. This is rather showing that these chief men of the Israelites were using music for reasons in contrast to David. David used music for the singing of praise to God, as can be seen in the Psalms and elsewhere. But these people mentioned in this verse were using music to serve their purposes in their indulgences.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "those who stretched themselves out" - In other words, those who rest in confidence, or those who are at ease and secure (the same sense as in verse 1). Another reading could be, "those who are recumbent."</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD" - This may also be read as, "for there is no reason for us to remember the name of the LORD."</p>
  <p>[v.13] - "horns" - In Hebrew, horns can signify eminence, strength, power, elevation, or any sort of defense.</p>
