  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/amos/MHC%20-%20Amos%2C%20Chapter%209.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Amos, Chapter 9</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the fifth and last vision the prophet saw; which represents the certain desolation of the land, city, and temple, and the slaughter of all sorts of persons, high and low, none should escape it (verse 1); [wherever they would be], they would be found out, whether in hell or heaven, on the tops of the highest mountains, or in the bottom of the sea, or in a foreign land, since the eyes of the Lord were upon them for evil (verses 2-4); nor could they hope to escape, when they considered his greatness and his power, and what he could do, and had done; and how they had behaved toward him, even though they were the people he had brought out of Egypt (verses 5-7); but though the sinful kingdom should be destroyed, yet not utterly, a remnant should be saved (verses 8-10); and the chapter is concluded with gracious promises of raising up the tabernacle of David [which had] fallen down, and of the return of the people of Israel to their own land; and of their settlement and continuance in it, never more to depart from it (verses 11-15).</p>
  <p>[v.1a] - "lintel" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">הכפתור</span> (ha-kaf-tore')—the capital of a column. The capital is the uppermost part of a column, pillar or pilaster, serving as the head or crowning, and placed immediately over the shaft, and under the entablature.</p>
  <p>[v.1b] - "Cut them in the head" - The Hebrew word from which head is translated is <span class="gr-heb">בראש</span> (buh-roshe), which in this case likely refers to the chief men, or the priests and rulers of the people.</p>
  <p>[v.1c] - "the last of them" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">ואחריתם</span> (wuh-a-ha-ree-tam')—the remnant, or those remaining. This is likely referring to the common people after the leaders were cut off (see note 1b).</p>
  <p>[v.2-4] - Reference, Psalm 139:7-8.</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "serpent" - This is to be understood as a large sea creature, such as Leviathan. Reference, Isaiah 27:1.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - "And it shall rise up wholly like a flood, etc." - See the note for Amos 8:8.</p>
  <p>[v.6a] - "upper chambers" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">מעלותו</span> (mah-a-low-tow')—elevation (that is, the act of elevating), to go up, ascents, steps or stairs to ascend. By this is meant the places ascended to, such as chambers, or upper chambers.</p>
  <p>[v.6b] - "vault" - Hebrew: <span class="gr-heb">ואגדתו</span> (wah-ag-ood-daw-tow'). This word can have a couple of different meanings for this verse. One meaning, as in the KJV, is troop, as in all the animate creatures, which are God's troop and do his will. This meaning is based on the usage of the same Hebrew word in 2nd Samuel 2:25 (see also Genesis 2:1). The other meaning is vault, as in a continued arch, or an arched roof. This would refer to the vaulted sky, or the firmament, which rests, or is founded, on the earth.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "grain" - Literally, "a binding," or something bound up, collected, or bundled, as in a parcel or pouch. This comes from the Hebrew word <span class="gr-heb">צרור</span> (tser-ore'). The Israelites will be collected in a sieve like grain.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "The evil shall not overtake nor fall upon us" - Compare with what is said of the scourge in Isaiah 28:15.</p>
  <p>[v.11-12] - Quoted in Acts 15:16-17.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "In that day" - That is, in the day when the promised Redeemer would come.</p>
  <p>[v.13] - Reference, Leviticus 26:5.</p>
