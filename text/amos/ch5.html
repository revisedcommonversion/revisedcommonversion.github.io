  <p>1 Hear this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "The virgin of Israel has fallen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She shall no longer rise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She is forsaken upon her land.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no one to raise her up."</p>
  </div>

  <p>3 For thus says the Lord GOD:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The city that went out by a thousand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall leave a hundred,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which went forth by a hundred<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall leave ten to the house of Israel."</p>
  </div>

  <p>4 For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Seek me and you shall live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> But do not seek Beth-el,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor enter into Gilgal,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not pass to Beer-sheba,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Beth-el shall come to nothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Seek the LORD and you shall live,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest he break out like fire<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the house of Joseph<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and devour it<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there be no one to quench it in Beth-el.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> You who turn judgment to wormwood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and leave off righteousness on the earth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Seek him who makes the seven stars and Orion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />turns the shadow of death into the morning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />makes the day dark with night,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who calls for the waters of the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pours them out upon the face of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />YAHWEH is his name.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He causes destruction to flash upon the strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that the destruction shall come against the fortress.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They hate him who rebukes in the gate<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Because your treading is upon the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you take burdens of wheat from him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore you have built houses of hewn stone,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall not dwell in them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you have planted pleasant vineyards,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but you shall not drink their wine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> For I know your manifold transgressions<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your mighty sins.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They afflict the just, they take a bribe,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they turn aside the poor in the gate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Therefore, the prudent shall keep silence in that time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for it is an evil time.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Seek good and not evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may live.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as you have spoken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Hate the evil and love the good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and establish judgment in the gate.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It may be that the LORD God of hosts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."</p>
  </div>

  <p>16 Therefore, Yahweh, the God of hosts, the Lord, says thus:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Wailing shall be in all streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they shall say in all the highways, 'Alas! Alas!'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they shall call the farmer to mourning<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> And in all vineyards there shall be wailing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will pass through you,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the LORD.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> "Woe to you who desire the day of the LORD!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />To what end is it for you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The day of the LORD is darkness and not light,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> As if a man fled from a lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a bear met him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a serpent bit him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Shall the day of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />not be darkness rather than light,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even very dark and no brightness in it?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> I hate, I despise your feast days<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Though you offer me burnt-offerings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your food-offerings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will not accept them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will I regard<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the peace-offerings of your fat beasts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Take away from me the noise of your songs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for I will not hear the melody of your harps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> But let judgment run down as waters<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> "Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Chiun, your images, the star of your god,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which you made for yourselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Therefore, I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>says the LORD, whose name is the God of hosts.</p>

  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/amos/MHC%20-%20Amos%2C%20Chapter%205.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Amos, Chapter 5</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet exhorts Israel to hear his lamentation over them for their impending ruin (verses 1-3); nevertheless to seek the Lord, and all that is good; to forsake their idols, and repent of their sins, in hopes of finding mercy, and living comfortably; or otherwise they must expect the wrath of God for their iniquities, especially their oppression of the poor (verses 4-15); otherwise it would be a time of weeping and wailing, of darkness and distress, however they might harden or flatter themselves, or make a jest of it (verses 16-20); for all their sacrifices and ceremonial worship would signify nothing, so long as they continued their idolatry with them (verses 21-26); and therefore should surely go into captivity (verse 27).</p>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, Deuteronomy 30:1-8; 1st Chronicles 28:9; 2nd Chronicles 15:2; Psalm 22:26, 69:32, 105:3-4; Isaiah 55:3, 6-7; Jeremiah 29:12-13; Lamentations 3:25-26; Ezekiel 18:32; Zephaniah 2:3; Matthew 7:8.</p>
  <p>[v.6a] - "Seek the LORD, and you shall live" - See the references for verse 4.</p>
  <p>[v.6b] - "lest he break out like fire, etc." - Reference, Deuteronomy 4:24, 9:3; Hebrews 12:29.</p>
  <p>[v.8a] - "Seek him who makes the seven stars and Orion" - This passage may be referring to the changing of the seasons. It mentions the seven stars, also known as Pleiades, which are present in the spring time. Then there is mention of Orion, which appears in the fall and winter. English translations almost always use the Greek names for these stars or constellations. The Hebrew names are Kiymah (kee-maw') and Kciyl (kes-eel') respectively.</p>
  <p>[v.8b] - Reference, Job 38:31.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Reference, Isaiah 33:1.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "they take a bribe" - This may also be read as, "they take the ransom." This shows the cruelty of the judges, for they hunted for crimes for the sake of gain, that is, they were only interested in receiving the ransom payment. The ransom payment was a bribe to the judges, which they gladly took.</p>
  <p>[v.21] - "I will not smell" - From the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary: "That is, I will take no delight in the sacrifices offered (Genesis 8:21; Leviticus 26:31)."</p>
  <p>[v.25] - Quoted in Acts 7:42.</p>
  <p>[v.26-27] - Quoted in Acts 7:43.</p>
  <p>[v.26] - From John Calvin's Commentary: "This place, we know, is quoted by Stephen in the seventh chapter of the Acts: but he followed the Greek version; and the Greek translator, whoever he was, was mistaken as to the word, Sicuth, and read, Sucoth, and thought the name an appellative of the plural number, and supposed it to be derived from <span class="gr-heb">סוך</span>, suk, which means a tabernacle; for he translated it <span class="gr-heb">σκηνην</span> as if it was said, 'You bore the tabernacle of your king instead of the ark.' But it was a manifest mistake; for the probability is, that Sicuth was the proper name of an idol."</p>
  <p>[v.27] - "Damascus" - From John Calvin's Commentary: "Why did the Prophet mention Damascus? This reason ought to be observed. It was because the Israelites thought that all the attacks of enemies would be prevented by having the city Damascus as their defense, which they supposed was impregnable. 'That fortress,' the Lord says, 'will not prevent me from taking you away, and removing you as far as the Assyrians.' We now see what the Prophet means, and why he expressly added the name of Damascus." This also explains why Stephen, in Acts 7:46, mentions Babylon, which at the time of Amos' prophesies was under Assyrian control.</p>
