    <p class="ch-outline">God's mercies must move us to please God, 1, 2. No man must think too well of himself, 3-5; but everyone attend on that calling wherein he is placed, 6-8. Love and many other duties are required of us, 9-18. Revenge is especially forbidden, 19-21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 I implore you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what is that good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.</p>

  <p>3 For through the grace given to me, I say, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, and all members do not have the same office, 5 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each members of one another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; 7 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering; or he who teaches, on teaching; 8 Or he who exhorts, on exhortation; he who gives, let him do it with simplicity; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>9 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil. Cleave to that which is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor preferring one another. 11 Do not be slothful in diligence. Be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. 12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue steadfastly in prayer. 13 Contribute to the needs of the saints and pursue hospitality.</p>

  <p>14 Bless those who persecute you. Bless, and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not mind high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Do not be wise in your own conceits. 17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 18 If it is possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men. 19 Dearly beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath, for it is written, "<cite>Vengeance is mine and I will repay,</cite>" says the Lord. 20 Therefore, "<cite>if your enemy hungers, feed him, and if he thirsts, give him drink, for in doing so you shall heap coals of fire on his head.</cite>" 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
