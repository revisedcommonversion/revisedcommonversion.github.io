  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea, 2 That you receive her in the Lord, as it is worthy for saints, and that you assist her in whatever business she has need of you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself also.</p>

  <p>3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus, 4 Who have for my life laid down their own necks, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 5 Likewise, greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epenetus, who is the first-fruits of Achaia to Christ. 6 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labor on us. 7 Salute Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me. 8 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 9 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 10 Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who are of Aristobulus' household. 11 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet those who are of the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord. 12 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord. 13 Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 14 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers who are with them. 15 Salute Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 16 Salute one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.</p>

  <p>17 Now I implore you, brothers, mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them. 18 For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 19 For your obedience has come abroad to all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf. But yet I would have you wise to that which is good, but innocent concerning evil. 20 And the God of peace will soon bruise Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>

  <p>21 Timothy my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen salute you.</p>

  <p>22 I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.</p>

  <p>23 Gaius, my host and also of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and also Quartus, a brother. 24 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

  <p>25 Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret since the world began, 26 But now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith— 27 To the only wise God be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.</p>
