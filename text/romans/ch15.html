    <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">The strong must bear with the weak, 1. We may not please ourselves, 2; for Christ did not do so, 3-6; but receive one another, as Christ did us all, 7; both Jews and Gentiles, 8-14; Paul excuses his writing, 15-27; and promises to see them, 28, 29; and requests their prayers, 30-33.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 We then who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves. 2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to edification. 3 For even Christ did not please himself, but, as it is written, "<cite>The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.</cite>" 4 For whatever things were written formerly were written for our learning so that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope. 5 Now may the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded toward one another according to Christ Jesus, 6 So that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>7 Therefore, receive one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God. 8 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made to the fathers, 9 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sing to your name.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 And again he says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>11 And again,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Praise him, all you people.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 And again Isaiah says,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>There shall be a root of Jesse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In him the Gentiles shall trust.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <p>14 And I myself also am persuaded concerning you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 15 Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me from God, 16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, so that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 17 Therefore, I have cause for glorying through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 18 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, 19 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and around to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 20 And so I have strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation, 21 But as it is written,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"<cite>They to whom he was not spoken of shall see,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who have not heard shall understand.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>22 For which cause I also have been much hindered from coming to you. 23 But now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come to you, 24 Whenever I take my journey into Spain I will come to you. For I trust to see you on my journey and to be brought on my way there by you, if first I may in some measure enjoy your company. 25 But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. 26 For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who are at Jerusalem. 27 It has pleased them truly, and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things. 28 When therefore I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go by you into Spain. 29 And I am sure that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>

  <p>30 Now I implore you, brothers, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me, 31 So that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 32 So that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and may be refreshed with you. 33 Now may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.3] - Quoting Psalm 69:9. (LXX)</p>
  <p>[v.9] - Quoting Psalm 18:49 (LXX). See also, 2nd Samuel 22:50.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Quoting Deuteronomy 32:43 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoting Psalm 117:1 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Quoting Isaiah 11:10 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.16] - Reference, Acts 22:21, 26:17-18; Romans 11:13; 2nd Timothy 1:11.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - This verse can also be written as, "For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ wrought through me for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed." This rendering avoids the double negative.</p>
  <p>[v.21] - Quoting Isaiah 52:15 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.24] - "enjoy" - Or, be satisfied with.</p>
