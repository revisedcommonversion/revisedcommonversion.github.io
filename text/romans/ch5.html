    <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, 1; and joy in our hope, 2-7; that since we were reconciled by his blood when we were enemies, 8, 9; we shall much more be saved, being reconciled, 10, 11. As sin and death came by Adam, 12-16; so much more righteousness and life by Jesus Christ, 17-19. Where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 20, 21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 By whom we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only this, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation works patience; 4 And patience, experience; and experience, hope. 5 And hope does not make us ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.</p>

  <p>6 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man some would even dare to die. 8 But God commends his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 9 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 11 And not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>

  <p>12 Therefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so also death passed upon all men, for all have sinned. 13 For until the law, sin was in the world. But sin is not imputed when there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him who was to come.</p>

  <p>15 But the free gift is not as the offense. For if through the offense of one many are dead, much more have the grace of God and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. 16 And the gift is not as through one who sinned. For the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offenses to justification. 17 For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>18 Therefore, as by the offense of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, so also by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life. 19 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one many shall be made righteous. 20 Moreover, the law entered so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, 21 So that as sin has reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righteousness to eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
