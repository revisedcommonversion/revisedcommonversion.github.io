    <h3>Chapter 10</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">The Scripture shows the difference between the righteousness of the law and that of faith, 1-10; and that all who believe, both Jew and Gentile, shall not be confounded, 11-17; and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe, 18. Israel was not ignorant of these things, 19-21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. 2 For I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they, being ignorant of God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</p>

  <p>5 For Moses describes the righteousness which is by the law: "<cite>The man who does these things shall live by them.</cite>" 6 But the righteousness which is by faith speaks in this way: "Do not say in your heart, '<cite>Who shall ascend into heaven?</cite>' (that is, to bring Christ down), 7 Or, '<cite>Who shall descend into the deep?</cite>' (that is, to bring Christ back from the dead)." 8 But what does it say? "<cite>The word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart.</cite>" That is, the word of faith which we preach: 9 That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved. 10 For with the heart man believes to righteousness and with the mouth confession is made to salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, "<cite>Whoever believes in him shall not be ashamed.</cite>" 12 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek. For the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon him, 13 For "<cite>whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</cite>"</p>

  <p>14 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "<cite>How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things!</cite>"</p>

  <p>16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "<cite>Lord, who has believed our report?</cite>" 17 So then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>

  <p>18 But I say, "Have they not heard?" Yes truly, "<cite>their sound went into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world.</cite>"</p>

  <p>19 But I say, "Did Israel not know?" First, Moses says, "<cite>I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</cite>"</p>

  <p>20 But Isaiah is very bold, and says, "<cite>I was found by those who did not seek me. I was made manifest to those who did not ask for me.</cite>"</p>

  <p>21 But to Israel he says, "<cite>All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.</cite>"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnUsU5e2PxarJiTkftdw0cj_dEVh9PkHkPawJCz4bso/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Romans, Chapter 10</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.4] - Reference, Matthew 5:17.</p>
  <p>[v.5] - Quoting Leviticus 18:5 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.6] - Quoting Deuteronomy 30:12 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Paraphrasing Deuteronomy 30:13. From John Calvin's Commentary: "Moses mentions heaven and the sea, as places remote and difficult of access to men. But Paul, as though there was some spiritual mystery concealed under these words, applies them to the death and resurrection of Christ. If any one thinks that this interpretation is too strained and too refined, let him understand that it was not the object of the Apostle strictly to explain this passage, but to apply it to the explanation of his present subject. He does not, therefore, repeat verbally what Moses has said, but makes alterations, by which he accommodates more suitably to his own purpose the testimony of Moses. He spoke of inaccessible places; Paul refers to those, which are indeed hid from the sight of us all, and may yet be seen by our faith. If then you take these things as spoken for illustration, or by way of improvement, you cannot say that Paul has violently or inaptly changed the words of Moses; but you will, on the contrary, allow, that without loss of meaning, he has, in a striking manner, alluded to the words heaven and the sea."</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoting Deuteronomy 30:14 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.11] - Quoting Isaiah 28:16.</p>
  <p>[v.13] - Quoting Joel 2:32 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.15] - Quoting Isaiah 52:7.</p>
  <p>[v.16] - Quoting Isaiah 53:1 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.17] - Reference, 2nd Timothy 3:15.</p>
  <p>[v.18] - Quoting Psalm 19:4 (LXX).</p>
  <p>[v.19] - Quoting Deuteronomy 32:21 (LXX—paraphrased).</p>
  <p>[v.20-21] - Quoting Isaiah 65:1-2 (LXX).</p>
