    <p class="ch-outline">We may not live in sin, 1; for we are dead to it, 2; as appears by our baptism, 3-11. Do not let sin reign anymore, 12-17; because we have yielded ourselves to the service of righteousness, 18-22; and for that death is the wages of sin, 23.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound? 2 By no means. How shall we, who are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 3 Do you not know, that as many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death? 4 Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection, 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him so that the body of sin may be destroyed, so that from now on we should not serve sin. 7 For he who is dead is freed from sin.</p>

  <p>8 Now if we are dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, 9 Knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over him. 10 For in that he died, he died to sin once, but in that he lives, he lives to God. 11 Likewise, reckon yourselves also to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

  <p>12 Do not let sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey it in its lusts. 13 Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace.</p>

  <p>15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? By no means. 16 Do you not know, that to the one you yield yourselves as slaves in obedience, you are slaves to the one you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? 17 But may God be thanked, that you were the slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you. 18 Being then made free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. 19 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members slaves to uncleanness and to iniquity, to [work] iniquity, even so now yield your members slaves to righteousness, to [work] holiness.</p>

  <p>20 For when you were the slaves of sin, you were free from righteousness. 21 What fruit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. 22 But now being made free from sin and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the result is everlasting life. 23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
