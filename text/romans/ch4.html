    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Abraham's faith was imputed to him for righteousness, 1-9; before he was circumcised, 10-12. By faith only he and his offspring received the promise, 13-15. Abraham is the father of all who believe, 16-23. Our faith also shall be imputed to us for righteousness, 24, 25.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 What shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found? 2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to glory about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? "<cite>Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness.</cite>" 4 Now to him who works, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 5 But to him who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 6 Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>7&emsp;Saying, "<cite>Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven <br />and whose sins are covered.</cite></p>

    <p>8&emsp;<cite>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</cite>"</p>
  </div>

  <p>9 Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say that faith was "<cite>reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</cite>" 10 How then was it reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had while still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are not circumcised, so that righteousness might be imputed to them also; 12 And the father of circumcision to those who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had while still uncircumcised.</p>

  <p>13 For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his offspring through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 14 For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, 15 Because the law works wrath, for where there is no law, there is no transgression.</p>

  <p>16 Therefore, it is of faith so that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the offspring, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all 17 (As it is written, "<cite>I have made you a father of many nations</cite>"), before him whom he believed, even God, who revives the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were, 18 Who, against hope, believed with hope that he should become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken: "<cite>Thus shall your offspring be.</cite>" 19 And not having been weak in faith, he did not consider his own body now dead when he was about one hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. 20 He did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, 21 And being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform. 22 And therefore, it was "<cite>imputed to him for righteousness.</cite>" 23 Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, 24 But for us also, to whom it will be imputed, if we believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 Who was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification.</p>
