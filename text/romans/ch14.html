  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Receive him who is weak in the faith, but not to doubtful disputations. 2 For one believes that he may eat all things, but another who is weak eats herbs. 3 Do not let him who eats despise him who does not eat, and do not let him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has received him. 4 Who are you who judge another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be held up, for God is able to make him stand.</p>

  <p>5 One man esteems one day above another, but another esteems every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 6 He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord, and he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks, and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. 7 For not one of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself. 8 For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 9 For to this end Christ both died, rose, and revived, so that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living.</p>

  <p>10 But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you set at nothing your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</p>

  <p>11 For it is written, "'As I live,' says the Lord, '<cite>every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.</cite>'"</p>

  <p>12 So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>

  <p>13 Let us not therefore judge one another anymore. But judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. 14 I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean by itself. But to him who esteems anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 15 But if your brother is grieved with your food, now you do not walk charitably. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died. 16 Therefore, do not let your good be evil spoken of, 17 For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who in these things serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things with which one may edify another. 20 For the sake of food, do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man who eats with offense. 21 It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak. 22 Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in that thing which he allows. 23 And he who doubts is condemned if he eats because he does not eat from faith, for whatever is not from faith is sin.</p>
