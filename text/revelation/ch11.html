  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And there was given to me a reed like a rod. And the angel stood, saying, "Rise, and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship in it. 2 But leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not measure it, for it is given to the Gentiles. And they shall tread under foot the holy city for forty-two months. 3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth." 4 These are the two olive-trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. 5 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. 6 These have power to shut heaven so that it may not rain in the days of their prophecy, and they have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire.</p>

  <p>7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them. 8 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 9 And those of the people, kindreds, languages, and nations shall see their dead bodies three and a half days and shall not allow their dead bodies to be put in graves. 10 And those who dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwelt on the earth.</p>

  <p>11 And after three and a half days, the Spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them. 12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them. 13 And the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell. And seven thousand men were killed in the earthquake. And the remnant were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>

  <p>14 The second woe is past, and behold, the third woe comes quickly.</p>

  <p>15 And the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign forever and ever." 16 And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God, 17 Saying, "We give you thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who is, was, and is to come, because you have taken your great power and have reigned. 18 And the nations were angry, but your wrath has come. And the time has come that the dead should be judged and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear your name, small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."</p>

  <p>19 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament. And there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.</p>
