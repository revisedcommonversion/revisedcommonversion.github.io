  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And after these things, I heard a great voice of many people in heaven, saying, "Alleluia. Salvation, glory, honor, and power to the Lord our God. 2 For '<cite>true and righteous are his judgments.</cite>' For he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her lewdness and has '<cite>avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</cite>'" 3 And again they said, "Alleluia. And '<cite>her smoke rose up forever and ever.</cite>'" 4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God who sat on the throne, saying, "Amen. Alleluia." 5 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all his servants, and who fear him, both small and great." 6 And I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, "Alleluia. For the Lord God, omnipotent, reigns.</p>

  <p>7 "Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready. 8 And it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white"—for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</p>

  <p>9 And he says to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'" And he says to me, "These are the true sayings of God." 10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, "Behold, do not do that. I am your fellow-servant and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."</p>

  <p>11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And he who sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written that no man knew, but he himself. 13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called, The Word of God. 14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 15 And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, so that with it he should smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron. And he treads the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 16 And he has on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, "KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS."</p>

  <p>17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come, and assemble yourselves to the supper of the great God, 18 So that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."</p>

  <p>19 And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies assembled to make war against him who sat on the horse and against his army.</p>

  <p>20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These were both cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse, which sword proceeds out of his mouth. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.</p>
