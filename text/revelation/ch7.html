    <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">An angel seals the servants of God in their foreheads, 3. The number of those who were sealed: of the tribes of Israel a certain number, 4-8. Of all other nations an innumerable multitude, which stand before the throne, clad in white robes and palms in their hands, 9-13.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And after these things, I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth so that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 3 Saying, "Do not hurt the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."</p>

  <p>4 And I heard the number of those who were sealed. And there were sealed one hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.</p>

  <p>5 Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand were sealed. 6 Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Naphtalim, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Manasses, twelve thousand were sealed. 7 Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Isachar, twelve thousand were sealed. 8 Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand were sealed. Of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.</p>

  <p>9 After this, I beheld, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number of all nations, kindreds, people, and languages, stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes and with palm branches in their hands. 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb." 11 And all the angels stood around the throne, the elders, and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God, 12 Saying, "Amen. Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen."</p>

  <p>13 And one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these who are arrayed in white robes? And where did they come from?" 14 And I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are those who came out of the great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 15 Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple. And he who sits on the throne will dwell among them. 16 They shall no longer hunger, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat. 17 For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them and will lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away all tears from their eyes."</p>
