  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. 2 And he laid hold upon the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, bound him a thousand years, 3 Cast him into the bottomless pit, shut him up, and set a seal upon him so that he should no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that, he must be released a little season.</p>

  <p>4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast nor his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. 6 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. On such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>

  <p>7 And when the thousand years have expired, Satan shall be released from his prison, 8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them to battle—the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth and encompassed the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. 10 And the devil who deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.</p>

  <p>11 And I saw a great white throne and him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was no place found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were each judged according to their works. 14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 15 And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2-3] - Reference, Deuteronomy 9:3-5; 33:27; John 10:28-29; Romans 8:2, 16:20.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - Reference, Deuteronomy 9:3-5; 33:27; John 10:28-29; Romans 8:2, 16:20.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "and there was no place found for them" - The Greek text here in this verse for that phrase exactly matches the Greek text in the Septuagint in Daniel 2:35.</p>
