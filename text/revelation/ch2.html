  <p>1 "<span class="woc">To the angel of the church of Ephesus, write: 'He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, says these things:</span></p>

  <p>2 "<span class="woc">I know your works, your labor, and your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tried those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them liars.</span> 3 <span class="woc">You have patience and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.</span> 4 <span class="woc">Nevertheless, I have this against you: that you have left your first love.</span> 5 <span class="woc">Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works. Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and will remove your candlestick out of its place unless you repent.</span> 6 <span class="woc">But this you have: that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> 7 <span class="woc">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."'</span></p>

  <p>8 "<span class="woc">And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write: 'The first and the last, who was dead and is alive, says these things:</span></p>

  <p>9 "<span class="woc">I know your works, tribulation, and poverty (but you are rich), and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span> 10 <span class="woc">Fear none of those things which you shall suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison so that you may be tried. And you shall have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death and I will give you a crown of life.</span> 11 <span class="woc">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes, shall not be hurt by the second death."'</span></p>

  <p>12 "<span class="woc">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write: 'He who has the sharp sword with two edges, says these things:</span></p>

  <p>13 "<span class="woc">I know your works and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is. And you hold firmly to my name and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you where Satan dwells.</span> 14 <span class="woc">But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit lewdness.</span> 15 <span class="woc">Likewise, you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span> 16 <span class="woc">Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> 17 <span class="woc">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no man knows, except he who receives it."'</span></p>

  <p>18 "<span class="woc">And to the angel of the church in Thyatira, write: 'The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass, says these things:</span></p>

  <p>19 "<span class="woc">I know your works, charity, service, faith, your patience, and your works—and the last works to be more than the first.</span> 20 <span class="woc">But, I have a few things against you, because you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit lewdness and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</span> 21 <span class="woc">And I gave her time to repent of her lewdness and she did not repent.</span> 22 <span class="woc">Behold, I will cast her into a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds.</span> 23 <span class="woc">And I will kill her children with death. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each of you according to your works.</span> 24 <span class="woc">But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, I will put upon you no other burden.</span> 25 <span class="woc">But that which you already have, hold firmly until I come.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And he who overcomes and keeps my works to the end, '<cite>to him I will give power over the nations,</cite></span> 27 <span class="woc"><cite>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to shivers,</cite>' even as I received of my Father.</span> 28 <span class="woc">And I will give him the morning-star.</span> 29 <span class="woc">He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'</span>"</p>
