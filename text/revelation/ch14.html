  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And I looked, and behold, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. 2 And I heard a voice from heaven, like the voice of many waters and like the voice of a great thunder. And I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps. 3 And they sang a new song before the throne, before the four beasts, and the elders. And no man could learn that song but the one hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. 4 These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first-fruits to God and to the Lamb. 5 And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the throne of God.</p>

  <p>6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth and to every nation, kindred, language, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to him, because the hour of his judgment has come. And worship him who made heaven, earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters."</p>

  <p>8 And there followed another angel, saying, "Babylon has fallen, that great city has fallen, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her lewdness."</p>

  <p>9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If any man worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment ascends up forever and ever. And they have no rest day or night who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints. Here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."</p>

  <p>13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.'" "Truly," says the Spirit, "in that they shall rest from their labors, for their works follow with them."</p>

  <p>14 And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and someone like the Son of man sat upon the cloud having a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Thrust in your sickle and reap, for the time has come for you to reap, because the harvest of the earth is ripe." 16 And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>

  <p>17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 18 And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe." 19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God. 20 And the wine-press was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the wine-press, even to the horses' bridles, by the space of one thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>
