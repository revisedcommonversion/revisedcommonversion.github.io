  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 2 And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</p>

  <p>3 And another angel having a golden censer came and stood at the altar. And much incense was given to him so that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God out of the angel's hand. 5 And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.</p>

  <p>6 And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</p>

  <p>7 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth. And the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</p>

  <p>8 And the second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea. And the third part of the sea became blood. 9 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life, died. And the third part of the ships were destroyed.</p>

  <p>10 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning like a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters. 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died by the waters because they were made bitter.</p>

  <p>12 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, along with the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was darkened. And the day did not shine for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</p>

  <p>13 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are about to sound!"</p>
