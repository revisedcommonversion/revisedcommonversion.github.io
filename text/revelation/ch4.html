  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet talking with me, which said, "Come up here and I will show you things which must be hereafter." 2 And immediately I was in the Spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven and someone sat on the throne. 3 And he who sat was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius stone. And there was a rainbow around the throne in sight like an emerald. 4 And around the throne were twenty-four seats, and upon the seats I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white clothing, and they had on their heads crowns of gold.</p>

  <p>5 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 6 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like crystal. And in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living beings full of eyes in front and behind. 7 And the first living being was like a lion, the second living being like a calf, the third living being had a face as a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle. 8 And the four living beings, each of them had six wings about him and they were full of eyes within. And they do not rest day or night, saying, "'<cite>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,</cite>' who was, and is, and is to come." 9 And when those living beings give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sat on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 10 The twenty-four elders fall down before him who sat on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. And they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 11 "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honor, and power, for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created."</p>
