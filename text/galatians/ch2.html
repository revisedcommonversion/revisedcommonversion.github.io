    <p class="ch-outline">Paul shows when he went up again to Jerusalem and for what purpose, 1, 2; and that Titus was not circumcised, 3-10; and that he resisted Peter and told him the reason, 11-13; why he and others, being Jews, do believe in Christ to be justified by faith and not by works, 14-19; and that they do not live in sin who are so justified, 20, 21.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Then fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also. 2 And I went by revelation and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain. 3 But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 4 That was because of false brothers unexpectedly brought in, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus so that they might bring us into bondage, 5 To whom we gave place by subjection, not even for an hour, so that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 6 But of these, who seemed to be something (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me—God accepts no man's person), for those who seemed to be something, in conference added nothing to me. 7 But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter 8 (For he who wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles), 9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hands of fellowship so that we should go to the heathen and they to the circumcision. 10 Only they asked that we should remember the poor, the same which I was also eager to do.</p>
  
  <p>11 But when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed. 12 For before some came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles, but when they had come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. 13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him so that Barnabas was also carried away with their dissimulation. 14 But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?</p>
  
  <p>15 "We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles, 16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ so that we may be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law, for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified. 17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves are also found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? By no means. 18 For if I again build the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. 19 For I, through the law, am dead to the law so that I may live to God. 20 I am crucified with Christ, yet it is not I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not frustrate the grace of God. For if righteousness is attainable by the law, then Christ has died in vain."</p>
