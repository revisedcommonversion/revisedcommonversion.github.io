    <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Paul moves them to deal mildly with a brother that has slipped, 1, and to bear one another's burden, 2-5; to be liberal to their teachers, 6-8, and not weary of well-doing, 9-11. He shows what they intend who preach circumcision, 12, 13. He glories in nothing, except in the cross of Christ, 14-18.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Brothers, if a man is overtaken in a fault, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted. 2 Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 3 For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 4 But let every man prove his own work, and then he shall have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another. 5 For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
  
  <p>6 Let him who is taught in the word communicate to him who teaches in all good things. 7 Do not be deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he shall also reap. 8 For he who sows to his flesh shall reap corruption from the flesh, but he who sows to the Spirit shall reap life everlasting from the Spirit. 9 And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we do not faint. 10 As we therefore have opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>
  
  <p>11 You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand. 12 As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised—only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised so that they may glory in your flesh. 14 But may it never be that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me and I to the world. 15 For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 16 And as many as walk according to this rule, may peace and mercy be upon them and upon the Israel of God.</p>
  
  <p>17 From now on let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
  
  <p>18 Brothers, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/galatians/MHC%20-%20Galatians%2C%20Chapter%206.md" target=_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Galatians, Chapter 6</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.7-8] - Reference, 2nd Corinthians 9:6. See also Galatians 5:16-24 where Paul lists specific things that are the result of sowing to the flesh and sowing to the Spirit. Note that Paul is not speaking of personal gain where you sow into some thing and reap of the same. For example, sowing money will not reap money. Paul is writing to tell us to sow to the gain of others, such as in the preaching of the Gospel and in acts of charity.</p>
  <p>[v.15] - Reference, 2nd Corinthians 5:17.</p>
