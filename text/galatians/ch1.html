    <p class="ch-outline">Paul wonders that they have so soon left him and the gospel, 1-7; and accurses those who preach any other gospel than he did, 8-10.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead), 2 And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</p>
  
  <p>3 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 4 Who gave himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father, 5 To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
  
  <p>6 I marvel that you are so soon removed from him who called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel, 7 Which is not another. But there are some who trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so I say now again: if any man preaches any other gospel to you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.</p>
  
  <p>10 For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
  <p>11 But I make known to you, brothers, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 12 For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
  
  <p>13 For you have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it, 14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 15 But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, 16 To reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the heathen, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood, 17 Neither did I go to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again to Damascus.</p>
  
  <p>18 Then after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. 19 But I saw no other of the apostles, except James the Lord's brother. 20 Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie. 21 Afterward, I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, 22 And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. 23 But they had only heard: "He who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which he once destroyed." 24 And they glorified God in me.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/galatians/MHC%20-%20Galatians%2C%20Chapter%201.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Galatians, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.12] - "by the revelation of Jesus Christ" - Reference, Acts 9:1-18.</p>
  <p>[v.18-19] - Reference, Acts 9:26-28.</p>
  <p>[v.19] - "James" - Properly, Jacob. Greek: <span class="gr-heb">Ἰάκωβον</span></p>
  <p>[v.21] - Reference, Acts 9:30. That verse mentions that Paul was sent to Tarsus, which is a city in Cilicia. From John Gill's Exposition: "For having disputed against the Grecians at Jerusalem, and being too hard for them, it so irritated them, that they were going to murder him; which being known to the brethren there, they got him out of the way, and had him down to Caesarea, and so to Tarsus, a city in Cilicia; where he was born; in which places and in the countries about he preached the Gospel of Christ; to Tarsus, Barnabas went for him seeking him, and finding him brought him to Antioch in Syria; and both in Syria and Cilicia he preached, no doubt with success, since we read of believing Gentiles and churches in those parts he afterwards visited; being sent along with others, with the letter and decrees of the synod at Jerusalem to them, and whom he confirmed."</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Reference, Acts 9:20-21.</p>
