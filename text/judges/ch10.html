  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar. And he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim. 2 And he judged Israel twenty-three years, died, and was buried in Shamir.</p>

  <p>3 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty-two years. 4 And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 5 And Jair died and was buried in Camon.</p>

  <p>6 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD and served Baalim, Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Zidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD and did not serve him. 7 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the children of Ammon. 8 And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years—all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 9 Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.</p>

  <p>10 And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, "We have sinned against you, both because we have forsaken our God and also served Baalim." 11 And the LORD said to the children of Israel, "Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians, from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 12 Also the Zidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 13 Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods. Therefore, I will deliver you no more. 14 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen. Let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation." 15 And the children of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do to us whatever seems good to you. Only deliver us, we pray you, this day." 16 And they put away the strange gods from among them and served the LORD, and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</p>

  <p>17 Then the children of Ammon were assembled and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves and encamped in Mizpeh. 18 And the people and princes of Gilead said to one another, "What man is he who will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."</p>
