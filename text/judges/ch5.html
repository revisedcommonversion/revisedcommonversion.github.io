  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</p>

  <p>2 "Praise the LORD for the avenging of Israel when the people willingly offered themselves.</p>

  <p>3 "Hear, O kings. Give ear, O princes. I, even I, will sing to the LORD. I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</p>

  <p>4 "LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.</p>

  <p>5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</p>

  <p>6 "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.</p>

  <p>7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel until I, Deborah, arose, until I arose a mother in Israel.</p>

  <p>8 They chose new gods, then war was in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</p>

  <p>9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the LORD.</p>

  <p>10 "Speak, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit in judgment and walk by the way.</p>

  <p>11 Those who are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there they shall rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel. Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates.</p>

  <p>12 "Awake, awake, Deborah. Awake, awake, utter a song. Arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, son of Abinoam.</p>

  <p>13 Then he made him who remains have dominion over the nobles among the people. The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>

  <p>14 Out of Ephraim there was a root of them against Amalek. After you was Benjamin among your people. Out of Machir governors came down, and out of Zebulun those who handle the pen of the writer.</p>

  <p>15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah, even Issachar,  wasnd also Barak. He was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</p>

  <p>16 Why did you abide among the sheep-folds to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.</p>

  <p>17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore and stayed in his breaches.</p>

  <p>18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people who jeopardized their lives to death in the high places of the field.</p>

  <p>19 "The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo. They took no gain of money.</p>

  <p>20 They fought from heaven. The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>

  <p>21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the Kishon River. O my soul, you have trodden down strength.</p>

  <p>22 "Then the horse's hooves were broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.</p>

  <p>23 "'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD, 'bitterly curse its inhabitants, because they did not come to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.'</p>

  <p>24 "Blessed above women Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be, blessed she shall be above women in the tent.</p>

  <p>25 He asked water, and she gave him milk. She brought forth butter in a lordly dish.</p>

  <p>26 She put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmen's hammer. And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head when she had pierced and struck through his temples.</p>

  <p>27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down. At her feet he bowed, he fell. Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>

  <p>28 "The mother of Sisera looked out of a window and cried through the lattice, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?'</p>

  <p>29 Her wise ladies answered her, and she returned answer to herself.</p>

  <p>30 'Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder: to every man a woman or two, to Sisera plunder of diverse colors, plunder of diverse colors of needle-work, of diverse colors of needle-work on both sides, suitable for the necks of those who take the plunder?'</p>

  <p>31 "So let all your enemies perish, O LORD. But let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might." And the land had rest forty years.</p>
