  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>2&emsp;"Praise the LORD for the avenging of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the people willingly offered themselves.</p>

    <p>3&emsp;"Hear, O kings. Give ear, O princes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, even I, will sing to the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</p>

    <p>4&emsp;"LORD, when you went out of Seir,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you marched out of the field of Edom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the clouds also dropped water.</p>

    <p>5&emsp;The mountains melted from before the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</p>

    <p>6&emsp;"In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the travelers walked through by-ways.</p>

    <p>7&emsp;The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I, Deborah, arose,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I arose a mother in Israel.</p>

    <p>8&emsp;They chose new gods,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then war was in the gates.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was there a shield or spear seen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among forty thousand in Israel?</p>

    <p>9&emsp;My heart is toward the governors of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who offered themselves willingly among the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bless the LORD.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;"Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who sit in judgment and walk by the way.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Those who are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there they shall rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;"Awake, awake, Deborah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Awake, awake, utter a song.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, son of Abinoam.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Then he made him who remains have dominion over the nobles among the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Out of Ephraim there was a root of them against Amalek.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />After you was Benjamin among your people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Out of Machir governors came down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and out of Zebulun those who handle the pen of the writer.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even Issachar, and also Barak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He was sent on foot into the valley.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the divisions of Reuben<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there were great thoughts of heart.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;Why did you abide among the sheep-folds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to hear the bleatings of the flocks?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the divisions of Reuben<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there were great searchings of heart.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And why did Dan remain in ships?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Asher continued on the sea-shore<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stayed in his breaches.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Zebulun and Naphtali were a people who jeopardized their lives to death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the high places of the field.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;"The kings came and fought,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then the kings of Canaan fought<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They took no gain of money.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;They fought from heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;The river of Kishon swept them away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that ancient river, the Kishon River.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O my soul, you have trodden down strength.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;"Then the horse's hooves were broken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;"'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'bitterly curse its inhabitants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they did not come to the help of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the help of the LORD against the mighty.'</p>

    <p>24&emsp;"Blessed above women Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blessed she shall be above women in the tent.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;He asked water, and she gave him milk.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She brought forth butter in a lordly dish.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;She put her hand to the nail<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her right hand to the workmen's hammer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when she had pierced and struck through his temples.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At her feet he bowed, he fell.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;"The mother of Sisera looked out of a window and cried<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />through the lattice, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?'</p>

    <p>29&emsp;Her wise ladies answered her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she returned answer to herself.</p>

    <p>30&emsp;'Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to every man a woman or two,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to Sisera plunder of diverse colors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />plunder of diverse colors of needle-work,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of diverse colors of needle-work on both sides,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />suitable for the necks of those who take the plunder?'</p>

    <p>31&emsp;"So let all your enemies perish, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might."</p>

  <p>And the land had rest forty years.</p>
