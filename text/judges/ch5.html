  <p>1 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> "Praise the LORD for the avenging of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the people willingly offered themselves.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> "Hear, O kings. Give ear, O princes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I, even I, will sing to the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> "LORD, when you went out of Seir,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you marched out of the field of Edom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the clouds also dropped water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The mountains melted from before the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the travelers walked through by-ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The inhabitants of the villages ceased,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />they ceased in Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I, Deborah, arose,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until I arose a mother in Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> They chose new gods,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then war was in the gates.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Was there a shield or spear seen<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among forty thousand in Israel?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> My heart is toward the governors of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who offered themselves willingly among the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Bless the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />you who sit in judgment and walk by the way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Those who are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there they shall rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then the people of the LORD shall go down to the gates.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> "Awake, awake, Deborah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Awake, awake, utter a song.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Arise, Barak, and lead your captivity captive, son of Abinoam.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Then he made him who remains have dominion over the nobles among the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Out of Ephraim there was a root of them against Amalek.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />After you was Benjamin among your people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Out of Machir governors came down,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and out of Zebulun those who handle the pen of the writer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even Issachar, and also Barak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He was sent on foot into the valley.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the divisions of Reuben<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there were great thoughts of heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Why did you abide among the sheep-folds<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to hear the bleatings of the flocks?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For the divisions of Reuben<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />there were great searchings of heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And why did Dan remain in ships?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Asher continued on the sea-shore<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stayed in his breaches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Zebulun was a people who jeopardized their lives to death,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> "The kings came and fought,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />then the kings of Canaan fought<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They took no gain of money.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> They fought from heaven.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> The river of Kishon swept them away,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that ancient river, the Kishon River.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />O my soul, you have trodden down strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "Then the horse's hooves were broken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the means of the prancings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the prancings of their mighty ones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> "'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'bitterly curse its inhabitants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they did not come to the help of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the help of the LORD against the mighty.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> "Blessed above women Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />blessed she shall be above women in the tent.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> He asked water, and she gave him milk.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She brought forth butter in a lordly dish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> She put her hand to the nail<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and her right hand to the workmen's hammer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And with the hammer she smote Sisera,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she smote off his head<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when she had pierced and struck through his temples.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />At her feet he bowed, he fell.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> "The mother of Sisera looked out of a window<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cried through the lattice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'Why is his chariot so long in coming?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Why do the wheels of his chariots delay?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Her wise ladies answered her,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she returned answer to herself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> 'Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to every man a woman or two,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to Sisera plunder of diverse colors,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />plunder of diverse colors of needle-work,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />of diverse colors of needle-work on both sides,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />suitable for the necks of those who take the plunder?'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> "So let all your enemies perish, O LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But let those who love him be as the sun<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he goes forth in his might."</p>

  <p>And the land had rest for forty years.</p>
