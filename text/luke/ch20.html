  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him, with the elders, 2 And spoke to him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority do you do these things? Or who is he who gave you this authority?" 3 And he answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">I will also ask you one thing. Answer me.</span> 4 <span class="woc">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?</span>" 5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' 6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet." 7 And they answered that they could not tell where it was from. 8 And Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span>"</p>

  <p>9 Then he began to speak to the people this parable: "<span class="woc">A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time.</span> 10 <span class="woc">And at the season he sent a servant to the farmers so that they should give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him away empty.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And again he sent another servant, and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</span> 12 <span class="woc">And again he sent the third, and they wounded him also and cast him out.</span> 13 <span class="woc">Then the lord of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be when they see him they will reverence him.'</span> 14 <span class="woc">But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him so that the inheritance may be ours.'</span> 15 <span class="woc">So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</span> 16 <span class="woc">He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.</span>" And when they heard it, they said, "May that never be."</p>

  <p>17 And he beheld them, and said, "<span class="woc">What is this then that is written: '<cite>The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner</cite>'?</span></p>

  <p>18 <span class="woc">Whoever falls upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.</span>"</p>

  <p>19 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him, and they feared the people, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 20 And they watched him and sent forth spies who should feign themselves to be just men so that they might take hold of his words, and that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor. 21 And they asked him, saying, "Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither do you accept the person of any, but teach the way of God truly. 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?" 23 But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, "<span class="woc">Why do you test me?</span> 24 <span class="woc">Show me a denarius. Whose image and superscription does it have?</span>" They answered and said, "Caesar's." 25 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's.</span>" 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people. And they marveled at his answer and held their peace.</p>

  <p>27 Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, came to him and they asked him, 28 Saying, "Master, Moses wrote to us that '<cite>if any man's brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.</cite>' 29 There were therefore seven brothers: the first took a wife and died without children, 30 the second took her for a wife and he died childless, 31 Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven all died and they left no children. 32 Last of all the woman also died. 33 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? For seven had her for a wife."</p>

  <p>34 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">The children of this world marry and are given in marriage,</span> 35 <span class="woc">But those who are accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage,</span> 36 <span class="woc">Neither can they die anymore, because they are equal to the angels and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</span> 37 <span class="woc">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed it at the bush when he calls the Lord '<cite>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</cite>'</span> 38 <span class="woc">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.</span>" 39 Then some of the scribes, answering, said, "Master, you have well said." 40 And after that, they dared not ask him any question at all.</p>

  <p>41 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">How do they say that Christ is David's son?</span> 42 <span class="woc">And David himself says in the book of Psalms, '<cite>The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit on my right hand,</cite></span></p>

  <p>43 <span class="woc"><cite>Until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."</cite>'</span> 44 <span class="woc">David therefore calls him Lord. How is he then his son?</span>"</p>

  <p>45 Then in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples, 46 "<span class="woc">Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, love greetings in the markets, the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts,</span> 47 <span class="woc">Who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers. The same shall receive greater condemnation.</span>"</p>
