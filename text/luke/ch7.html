  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>

  <p>2 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. 3 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent the elders of the Jews to him imploring him that he would come and heal his servant. 4 And when they came to Jesus, they implored him earnestly, saying, "He is worthy for you to do this, 5 For he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue." 6 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; 7 Therefore, neither did I think myself worthy to come to you. But say in a word and my servant shall be healed. 8 For I also am a man set under authority and have under me soldiers. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 9 When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him and turned himself around and said to the people who followed him, "<span class="woc">I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel.</span>" 10 And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.</p>

  <p>11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him, along with many people. 12 Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and many people of the city were with her. 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her, "<span class="woc">Do not weep.</span>" 14 And he came and touched the bier. And those who bore him stood still. And he said, "<span class="woc">Young man, I say to you, arise.</span>" 15 And he who was dead sat up and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother. 16 And there came a fear on all and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has risen among us," and, "God has visited his people." 17 And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the neighboring region.</p>

  <p>18 And the disciples of John informed him of all these things. 19 And John, calling two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you he who should come? Or do we look for another?" 20 When the men had come to him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, 'Are you he who should come? Or do we look for another?'" 21 And in that same hour he cured many of infirmities, diseases, and evil spirits, and to many who were blind he gave sight. 22 Then Jesus, answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">Go, and tell John what things you have seen and heard: '<cite>the blind see,</cite>' '<cite>the lame walk,</cite>' lepers are cleansed, '<cite>the deaf hear,</cite>' the dead are raised, and '<cite>the gospel is preached to the poor.</cite>'</span> 23 <span class="woc">And blessed is he to whom I shall not be a stumbling block.</span>"</p>

  <p>24 And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, "<span class="woc">What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</span> 25 <span class="woc">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live delicately are in kings' courts.</span> 26 <span class="woc">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span></p>

  <p>27 "<span class="woc">This is he concerning whom it is written, '<cite>Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.</cite>'</span></p>

  <p>28 "<span class="woc">For I say to you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span>" 29 And all the people and the tax collectors who heard him justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves by not being baptized by him.</p>

  <p>31 And the Lord said, "<span class="woc">To what then shall I compare the men of this generation? And to what are they like?</span> 32 <span class="woc">They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling to one another, and saying, 'We have piped to you and you have not danced. We have mourned to you and you have not wept.'</span> 33 <span class="woc">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</span> 34 <span class="woc">The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man, a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'</span> 35 <span class="woc">But wisdom is justified by all her children.</span>"</p>

  <p>36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house and sat down at the table. 37 And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster-box of ointment, 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears, then wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, "This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is who touches him, for she is a sinner."</p>

  <p>40 And Jesus, answering, said to him, "<span class="woc">Simon, I have something to say to you.</span>" And he says, "Master, speak." 41 "<span class="woc">There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.</span> 42 <span class="woc">And when they had nothing to pay, he freely forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</span>" 43 Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave most." And he said to him, "<span class="woc">You have rightly judged.</span>" 44 And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, "<span class="woc">Do you see this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</span> 45 <span class="woc">You gave me no kiss, but this woman, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.</span> 46 <span class="woc">You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.</span> 47 <span class="woc">Therefore, I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</span>" 48 And he said to her, "<span class="woc">Your sins are forgiven.</span>" 49 And those who sat at the table with him began to say within themselves, "Who is this who forgives sins also?" 50 And he said to the woman, "<span class="woc">Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</span>"</p>
