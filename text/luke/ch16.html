  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he also said to his disciples, "<span class="woc">There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was made to him that this man had wasted his goods.</span> 2 <span class="woc">And he called him and said to him, 'How is it that I hear this of you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you may no longer be steward.'</span> 3 <span class="woc">Then the steward said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my lord takes from me the stewardship. I cannot dig. I am ashamed to beg.</span> 4 <span class="woc">I have resolved what to do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.'</span> 5 <span class="woc">So he called each of his lord's debtors, and said to the first, 'How much do you owe to my lord?'</span> 6 <span class="woc">And he said, 'One hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.'</span> 7 <span class="woc">Then he said to another, 'And how much do you owe?' And he said, 'One hundred measures of wheat.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill and write eighty.'</span> 8 <span class="woc">And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</span> 9 <span class="woc">And I say to you, make for yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</span></p>

  <p>10 "<span class="woc">He who is faithful in that which is least is also faithful in much, and he who is unjust in the least is also unjust in much.</span> 11 <span class="woc">If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</span> 12 <span class="woc">And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give you that which is your own?</span> 13 <span class="woc">No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</span>"</p>

  <p>14 And the Pharisees, who were covetous, also heard all these things, and they derided him. 15 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</span></p>

  <p>16 "<span class="woc">The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it.</span> 17 <span class="woc">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than one tittle of the law to fail.</span></p>

  <p>18 "<span class="woc">Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whoever marries her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.</span></p>

  <p>19 "<span class="woc">There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.</span> 20 <span class="woc">And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus who was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span> 21 <span class="woc">And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> 22 <span class="woc">And it came to pass, that the beggar died and was carried by angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> 23 <span class="woc">And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham afar off with Lazarus in his bosom.</span> 24 <span class="woc">And he cried, and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.'</span> 25 <span class="woc">But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that in your life-time you received your good things, and Lazarus, in like manner, evil things. But now he is comforted and you are tormented.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who would pass from here to you cannot, neither can they pass to us who would come from there.'</span> 27 <span class="woc">Then he said, 'I pray you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,</span> 28 <span class="woc">For I have five brothers, so that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.'</span> 29 <span class="woc">Abraham says to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.'</span> 30 <span class="woc">And he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'</span> 31 <span class="woc">And he said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.'</span>"</p>
