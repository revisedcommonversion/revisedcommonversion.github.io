    <p class="ch-outline">Christ commends the poor widow, 1-4. He foretells the destruction of the temple and of the city of Jerusalem, 5-24; the signs also which shall be before the last day, 25-33. He exhorts them to be watchful, 34-38.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he looked up and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 2 And he also saw a certain poor widow casting in there two mites. 3 And he said, "<span class="woc">Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all of them.</span> 4 <span class="woc">For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God, but she of her penury has cast in all the living that she had.</span>"</p>

  <p>5 And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts, he said, 6 "<span class="woc">As for these things which you behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.</span>"</p>

  <p>7 And they asked him, saying, "Master, but when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?" 8 And he said, "<span class="woc">Take heed that you do not be deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am Christ,' and, 'The time draws near.' Therefore, do not go after them.</span> 9 <span class="woc">But when you hear of wars and commotions, do not be terrified. For these things must first come to pass, but the end will not come immediately.</span>"</p>

  <p>10 Then he said to them, "<span class="woc">Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.</span> 11 <span class="woc">Great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences will be in various places. And there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</span></p>

  <p>12 "<span class="woc">But before all these, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.</span> 13 <span class="woc">And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</span> 14 <span class="woc">Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand what you shall answer.</span> 15 <span class="woc">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</span> 16 <span class="woc">And you will be betrayed by parents, brothers, kinsmen, and friends, and some of you they will cause to be put to death.</span> 17 <span class="woc">And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake.</span> 18 <span class="woc">But there shall not a hair of your head perish.</span> 19 <span class="woc">In your patience you possess your souls.</span></p>

  <p>20 "<span class="woc">And when you see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that its desolation is near.</span> 21 <span class="woc">Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of it depart from it, and do not let those who are in the countries enter into it.</span> 22 <span class="woc">For these are the days of vengeance so that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</span> 23 <span class="woc">But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</span> 24 <span class="woc">And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span></p>

  <p>25 "<span class="woc">And there shall be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves.</span> 26 <span class="woc">Men's hearts will fail them for fear and for apprehension of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</span> 27 <span class="woc">And then they shall see '<cite>the Son of man coming in a cloud</cite>' with power and great glory.</span> 28 <span class="woc">And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.</span>"</p>

  <p>29 And he spoke to them a parable: "<span class="woc">Behold the fig-tree and all the trees.</span> 30 <span class="woc">When they now shoot forth, you see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand.</span> 31 <span class="woc">So likewise, when you see these things come to pass, you know that the kingdom of God is near at hand.</span> 32 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, this generation shall not pass away until all is fulfilled.</span> 33 <span class="woc">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away.</span></p>

  <p>34 "<span class="woc">And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts are overcharged with surfeiting, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.</span> 35 <span class="woc">For as a snare, it shall come on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</span> 36 <span class="woc">Therefore, be watchful all the time, praying that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man.</span>"</p>

  <p>37 In the day-time he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out and stayed on the mountain that is called the Mount of Olives. 38 And all the people came to him early in the morning to hear him in the temple.</p>
