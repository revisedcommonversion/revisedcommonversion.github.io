  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Then he said to the disciples, "<span class="woc">It is impossible for the causes of sin to not come. But woe to him by whom they come!</span> 2 <span class="woc">It would be better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.</span> 3 <span class="woc">Take heed to yourselves. If your brother trespasses against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</span> 4 <span class="woc">And if he trespasses against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns back to you, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him.</span>"</p>

  <p>5 And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith." 6 And the Lord said, "<span class="woc">If you had faith as a grain of mustard-seed, you might say to this sycamine-tree, 'Be plucked up by the root and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.</span></p>

  <p>7 "<span class="woc">But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately when he has come from the field, 'Go and sit down to eat'?</span> 8 <span class="woc">Would he not rather say to him, 'Make ready with which I may have supper, gird yourself, and serve me until I have eaten and drank, and afterward, you shall eat and drink'?</span> 9 <span class="woc">Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded of him? I suppose not.</span> 10 <span class="woc">So likewise you, when you have done all the things which are commanded of you, say, 'We are unprofitable servants. We have done that which was our duty to do.'</span>"</p>

  <p>11 And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 12 And as he entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him there, who stood at a distance. 13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." 14 And when he saw them, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Go, show yourselves to the priests.</span>" And it came to pass, that as they were going, they were cleansed. 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. 17 And Jesus, answering, said, "<span class="woc">Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</span> 18 <span class="woc">There was no one found returning to give glory to God, except this stranger.</span>" 19 And he said to him, "<span class="woc">Arise, depart. Your faith has made you whole.</span>"</p>

  <p>20 And when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, "<span class="woc">The kingdom of God does not come with observation,</span> 21 <span class="woc">Neither will they say, 'Behold here!' or, 'Behold there!' For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</span>"</p>

  <p>22 And he said to his disciples, "<span class="woc">The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.</span> 23 <span class="woc">And they will say to you, 'See here,' or, 'See there.' Do not go after them, nor follow them.</span> 24 <span class="woc">For as the lightning that lightens from one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so the Son of man shall also be in his day.</span> 25 <span class="woc">But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And as it was in the days of Noah, so it shall also be in the days of the Son of man:</span> 27 <span class="woc">They ate, they drank, they married wives, and they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> 28 <span class="woc">Likewise also, as it was in the days of Lot—they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, and they built,</span> 29 <span class="woc">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all—</span> 30 <span class="woc">Even thus it shall be on the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span> 31 <span class="woc">On that day, he who is upon the house-top, with his goods in the house, must not come down to take them away. And he who is in the field, likewise must not return back.</span> 32 <span class="woc">Remember Lot's wife.</span> 33 <span class="woc">Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life shall preserve it.</span> 34 <span class="woc">I tell you, on that night there will be two in one bed: one will be taken and the other will be left.</span> 35 <span class="woc">Two women will be grinding together: one will be taken and the other left.</span> 36 <span class="woc">Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left.</span>" 37 And they answered and said to him, "Where Lord?" And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be collected.</span>"</p>
