  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared, and there were others with them. 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher. 3 And they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed at this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. 5 And as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead? 6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee, 7 Saying, 'The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise again.'" 8 Then they remembered his words, 9 And returned from the sepulcher and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women who were with them who told these things to the apostles. 11 Their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them. 12 Then Peter arose and ran to the sepulcher, and stooping down, he beheld the linen cloths laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.</p>

  <p>13 And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs. 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 15 And it came to pass, that while they talked together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 16 But their eyes were held so that they should not know him. 17 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">What manner of communications are these that you have to one another as you walk, and are sad?</span>" 18 And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said to him, "Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem and have not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?" 19 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">What things?</span>" And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him. 21 But we trusted that it had been he who would have redeemed Israel. And besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done. 22 And even some women of our company made us astonished. They were early at the sepulcher, 23 And when they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive. 24 And some of them who were with us went to the sepulcher and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him." 25 Then he said to them, "<span class="woc">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> 26 <span class="woc">Did Christ not have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?</span>" 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>

  <p>28 And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he would go further. 29 But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening and the day is far spent." And he went in to stay with them. 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at the table with them, he took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. 31 And their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. 32 And they said to one another, "Did our heart not burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened the Scriptures to us?" 33 And they rose the same hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled and those who were with them, 34 Saying, "The Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon." 35 And they told the things that were done in the way and how he was made known to them in breaking of bread.</p>

  <p>36 And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and says to them, "<span class="woc">Peace be to you.</span>" 37 But they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Why are you troubled? And why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</span> 39 <span class="woc">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.</span>" 40 And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet. 41 And while they yet did not believe for joy and wondered, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Do you have anything here for food?</span>" 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and a honey-comb. 43 And he took it and ate before them.</p>

  <p>44 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written concerning me in the law of Moses, in the prophets, and in the psalms.</span>" 45 Then he opened their understanding so that they might understand the Scriptures, 46 And said to them, "<span class="woc">Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,</span> 47 <span class="woc">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> 48 <span class="woc">And you are witnesses of these things.</span> 49 <span class="woc">And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.</span>"</p>

  <p>50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. 51 And it came to pass, while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 52 And they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
