  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 After these things, the Lord appointed another seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself would come. 2 Therefore, he said to them, "<span class="woc">The harvest is truly great, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.</span> 3 <span class="woc">Go. Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</span> 4 <span class="woc">Carry neither purse, nor sack, nor shoes, and salute no man by the way.</span> 5 <span class="woc">And into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house.'</span> 6 <span class="woc">And if the son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it, but if not, it shall turn back to you.</span> 7 <span class="woc">And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.</span> 8 <span class="woc">And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.</span> 9 <span class="woc">And heal the sick who are therein, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'</span> 10 <span class="woc">But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets of the same, and say,</span> 11 <span class="woc">'Even the very dust of your city which cleaves on us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless, be sure of this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.'</span> 12 <span class="woc">But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that city.</span></p>

  <p>13 "<span class="woc">Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they would have a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> 14 <span class="woc">But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</span> 15 <span class="woc">And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell.</span></p>

  <p>16 "<span class="woc">He who hears you hears me, and he who despises you despises me, and he who despises me despises him who sent me.</span>"</p>

  <p>17 And the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us through your name." 18 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">I beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven.</span> 19 <span class="woc">Behold, I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. And nothing shall by any means hurt you.</span> 20 <span class="woc">Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.</span>"</p>

  <p>21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit, and said, "<span class="woc">I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babies. Indeed, Father, for thus it seemed good in your sight.</span> 22 <span class="woc">All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no man knows who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</span>"</p>

  <p>23 And he turned himself to his disciples, and said privately, "<span class="woc">Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.</span> 24 <span class="woc">For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them, and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them.</span>"</p>

  <p>25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" 26 He said to him, "<span class="woc">What is written in the law? How do you read it?</span>" 27 And answering, he said, "'<cite>You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,</cite>' and '<cite>your neighbor as yourself.</cite>'" 28 And he said to him, "<span class="woc">You have answered rightly. Do this, and you shall live.</span>" 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</p>

  <p>30 And Jesus, answering, said, "<span class="woc">A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> 31 <span class="woc">And by chance a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</span> 32 <span class="woc">And likewise, a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked at him, and passed by on the other side.</span> 33 <span class="woc">But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</span> 34 <span class="woc">And went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> 35 <span class="woc">And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii and gave them to the host and said to him, 'Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I come back I will repay you.'</span> 36 <span class="woc">Which now of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?</span>" 37 And he said, "He who showed mercy to him." Then Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Go, and do likewise.</span>"</p>

  <p>38 Now it came to pass, as they were going, he entered into a certain village. And a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house. 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard his word. 40 But Martha was encumbered with much serving and came to him, and said, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore to help me." 41 And Jesus answered, and said to her, "<span class="woc">Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.</span> 42 <span class="woc">But one thing is needful, and Mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her.</span>"</p>
