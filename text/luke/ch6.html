  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through grain-fields, and his disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. 2 And some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days?" 3 And Jesus, answering them, said, "<span class="woc">Have you not read so much as this, what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him,</span> 4 <span class="woc">How he went into the house of God, took and ate the show-bread, and also gave to those who were with him, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</span>" 5 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</span>"</p>

  <p>6 And it also came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught. And there was a man whose right hand was withered. 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him to see whether he would heal on the sabbath so that they might find an accusation against him. 8 But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, "<span class="woc">Rise and stand forth in the midst.</span>" And he arose and stood forth. 9 Then Jesus said to them, "<span class="woc">I will ask you one thing: is it lawful on the sabbath-days to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?</span>" 10 And looking around at them all, he said to the man, "<span class="woc">Stretch forth your hand.</span>" And he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other. 11 And they were filled with madness and communed with one another what they might do to Jesus.</p>

  <p>12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out to a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God. 13 And when it was day, he called his disciples to him, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named Apostles: 14 Simon (whom he also named Peter) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, Simon called Zelotes, 16 Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot (who also was the traitor).</p>

  <p>17 And he came down with them and stood in the plain, with the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judea, Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, 18 And also those who were afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were healed. 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him, for power went out of him and healed them all.</p>

  <p>20 And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said, "<span class="woc">Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> 21 <span class="woc">Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> 22 <span class="woc">Blessed are you when men hate you and when they separate you from their company, reproach you, and cast out your name as evil on account of the Son of man.</span> 23 <span class="woc">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For their fathers did likewise to the prophets.</span> 24 <span class="woc">But woe to you who are rich! For you have received your consolation.</span> 25 <span class="woc">Woe to you who are full! For you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now! For you shall mourn and weep.</span> 26 <span class="woc">Woe to you, when all men speak well of you! For thus their fathers did to the false prophets.</span></p>

  <p>27 "<span class="woc">But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> 28 <span class="woc">Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.</span> 29 <span class="woc">And to him who smites you on one cheek, offer the other also. And to him who takes away your cloak, do not forbid to take your coat also.</span> 30 <span class="woc">Give to every man who asks of you, and of him who takes away your goods, do not ask for them back.</span> 31 <span class="woc">And as you wish that men should do to you, do also to them likewise.</span> 32 <span class="woc">For if you love those who love you, what thanks do you have? For sinners also love those who love them.</span> 33 <span class="woc">And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you have? For sinners even do the same.</span> 34 <span class="woc">And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks do you have? For sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much in return.</span> 35 <span class="woc">But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing back, and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest, for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</span> 36 <span class="woc">Therefore, be merciful, as your Father is also merciful.</span></p>

  <p>37 "<span class="woc">Do not judge, and you shall not be judged. Do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.</span> 38 <span class="woc">Give, and it shall be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, men shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you give to others, it shall be measured back to you.</span>"</p>

  <p>39 And he spoke a parable to them: "<span class="woc">Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?</span> 40 <span class="woc">The disciple is not above his master, but everyone who is perfect shall be as his master.</span> 41 <span class="woc">And why do you behold the mote that is in your brother's eye, but not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?</span> 42 <span class="woc">Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in your eye,' when you yourself do not behold the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye, and then you shall see clearly to pull out the mote that is in your brother's eye.</span> 43 <span class="woc">For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit, neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span> 44 <span class="woc">For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.</span> 45 <span class="woc">A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil. For from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span></p>

  <p>46 "<span class="woc">And why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do the things which I say?</span> 47 <span class="woc">Whoever comes to me, hears my sayings, and does them, I will show you to whom he is like.</span> 48 <span class="woc">He is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock.</span> 49 <span class="woc">But he who hears and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.</span>"</p>
