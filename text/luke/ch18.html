  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint, 2 Saying, "<span class="woc">There was a judge in a city who did not fear God, nor regard man.</span> 3 <span class="woc">And there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, 'Avenge me of my adversary.'</span> 4 <span class="woc">And he would not for a while. But afterward, he said within himself, 'Though I do not fear God, nor regard man,</span> 5 <span class="woc">Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.'</span>" 6 And the Lord said, "<span class="woc">Hear what the unjust judge says.</span> 7 <span class="woc">And will God not avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he bears long with them?</span> 8 <span class="woc">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</span>"</p>

  <p>9 And he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 10 "<span class="woc">Two men went up into the temple to pray: one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> 11 <span class="woc">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not as other men are: extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</span> 12 <span class="woc">I fast twice in the week. I give tithes of all that I possess.'</span> 13 <span class="woc">And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his chest, saying, 'God be merciful to me a sinner.'</span> 14 <span class="woc">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself shall be abased, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.</span>"</p>

  <p>15 And they also brought infants to him so that he might touch them. But when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called them to him, and said, "<span class="woc">Allow little children to come to me and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> 17 <span class="woc">Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no way enter into it.</span>"</p>

  <p>18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, "Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" 19 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Why do you call me good? No one is good, save one: God.</span> 20 <span class="woc">You know the commandments: '<cite>Do not commit adultery,</cite>' '<cite>Do not kill,</cite>' '<cite>Do not steal,</cite>' '<cite>Do not bear false witness,</cite>' '<cite>Honor your father and your mother.</cite>'</span>" 21 And he said, "All these I have kept from my youth." 22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, "<span class="woc">Yet you lack one thing: sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.</span>" 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich. 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, "<span class="woc">How hardly those who have riches will enter into the kingdom of God!</span> 25 <span class="woc">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span>" 26 And those who heard it, said, "Who then can be saved?" 27 Then he said, "<span class="woc">The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span>"</p>

  <p>28 Then Peter said, "Behold, we have left all and followed you." 29 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Truly I say to you, there is no man who has left house, parents, brothers, wife, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> 30 <span class="woc">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and life everlasting in the age to come.</span>"</p>

  <p>31 Then he took the twelve, and said to them, "<span class="woc">Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</span> 32 <span class="woc">For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, mocked, spitefully treated, and spit upon.</span> 33 <span class="woc">And they will scourge him and put him to death, and on the third day he will rise again.</span>" 34 But they understood none of these things, and this saying was hid from them, neither did they know the things which were spoken.</p>

  <p>35 And it came to pass, that as he had come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging. 36 And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. 37 And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. 38 And he cried, saying, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me." 39 And those who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. But he cried so much the more: "Son of David, have mercy on me." 40 And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he had come near, he asked him, 41 Saying, "<span class="woc">What do you wish that I shall do to you?</span>" And he said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." 42 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Receive your sight. Your faith has saved you.</span>" 43 And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And when they saw it, all the people gave praise to God.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Za0Q9rNU8CqOiRHOKI2R5wtRsslkzPkhQgGvV3mRFQ0/edit" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Luke, Chapter 18</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.5] - "she weary me" - Literally, "she blacken me under the eye." From Clarke's Commentary: "A metaphor taken from boxers, who bruise each other, and by beating each other about the face blacken the eyes." This word is also used in 1st Corinthians 9:27, where it is translated as, "buffet." Barnes' Notes on the Bible gives a good explanation of what is meant by the use of this word by saying that this weariness is "any vexatious and troublesome importunity that takes the time, and disables from other employment." It is as if the woman beats down the judge with her continual coming to him; therefore, he gives in to her request.</p>
