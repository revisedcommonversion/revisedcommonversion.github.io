    <p class="ch-outline">Of Zaccheus a tax collector, 1-10. The ten pieces of money, 11-27.

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. 2 And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the tax collectors, and he was rich. 3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was little of stature. 4 And he ran ahead and climbed up upon a sycamore-tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, "<span class="woc">Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at your house.</span>" 6 And he made haste, came down, and received him joyfully. 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying that he had gone to be guest with a man who is a sinner. 8 And Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him four-fold." 9 And Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">This day salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</span> 10 <span class="woc">For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</span>"</p>

  <p>11 And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear. 12 He said therefore, "<span class="woc">A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</span> 13 <span class="woc">And he called his ten servants and delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, 'Occupy until I come.'</span> 14 <span class="woc">But his citizens hated him and sent a message after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'</span> 15 <span class="woc">And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, so that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</span> 16 <span class="woc">Then the first came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has gained ten minas.'</span> 17 <span class="woc">And he said to him, 'Well done, good servant. Because you have been faithful in a very little, you have authority over ten cities.'</span> 18 <span class="woc">And the second came, saying, 'Lord, your mina has gained five minas.'</span> 19 <span class="woc">And he said likewise to him, 'You are to be over five cities.'</span> 20 <span class="woc">And another came, saying, 'Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I have kept laid up in a handkerchief,</span> 21 <span class="woc">For I feared you because you are an austere man. You take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.'</span> 22 <span class="woc">And he says to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew me to be an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.</span> 23 <span class="woc">Why then did you not put my money into the bank? And I, having come, might have collected it with interest.'</span> 24 <span class="woc">And he said to those who stood by, 'Take from him the mina and give it to him who has ten minas.'</span> 25 <span class="woc">And they said to him, 'Lord, he has ten minas.'</span> 26 <span class="woc">'For I say to you, that to everyone who has shall be given, and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</span> 27 <span class="woc">But these enemies of mine who did not wish that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.'</span>"</p>

  <p>28 And when he had thus spoken, he went ahead, ascending toward Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>29 And it came to pass, when he had come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 30 Saying, "<span class="woc">Go into the village over against you, in which at your entering you will find a colt tied, on which no man has ever sat. Untie him and bring him here.</span> 31 <span class="woc">And if any man asks you, 'Why do you untie him?' you shall say thus to him: 'Because the Lord has need of him.'</span>" 32 And those who were sent, went and found even as he had said to them. 33 And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why do you untie the colt?" 34 And they said, "The Lord has need of him." 35 Then they brought him to Jesus, cast their garments upon the colt, and set Jesus upon him. 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 37 And when he had come near, even now at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, 38 Saying,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"'<cite>Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord.</cite>'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Peace in heaven and glory in the highest."</p>
  </div>

  <p>39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, "Master, rebuke your disciples." 40 And he answered and said to them, "<span class="woc">I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</span>"</p>

  <p>41 And when he had come near, he beheld the city and wept over it, 42 Saying, "<span class="woc">If you, even you, had only known in this day the things which belong to your peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.</span> 43 <span class="woc">For the days shall come upon you, that your enemies shall build a barricade around you, encompass you, keep you in on every side,</span> 44 <span class="woc">And shall level you and your children within you to the ground. And they shall not leave in you one stone upon another because you did not know the time of your visitation.</span>"</p>

  <p>45 And he went into the temple and began to cast out those who sold in it and those who bought, 46 Saying to them, "<span class="woc">It is written, '<cite>My house is the house of prayer,</cite>' but you have made it '<cite>a den of thieves.</cite>'</span>"</p>

  <p>47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 48 And could not find what they might do, for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>
