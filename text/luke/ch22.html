  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover. 2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.</p>

  <p>3 Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 4 And he went and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him to them. 5 And they were glad and covenanted to give him money. 6 And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude.</p>

  <p>7 Then the day of unleavened bread came when the passover must be killed. 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, "<span class="woc">Go and prepare for us the passover so that we may eat.</span>" 9 And they said to him, "Where do you wish that we prepare?" 10 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man bearing a pitcher of water shall meet you there. Follow him into the house where he enters.</span> 11 <span class="woc">And you shall say to the master of the house, 'The Master says to you, "Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?"'</span> 12 <span class="woc">And he will show you a large upper room furnished. Make ready there.</span>" 13 And they went and found as he had said to them, and they made ready the passover.</p>

  <p>14 And when the hour had come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 15 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.</span> 16 <span class="woc">For I say to you, I will not anymore eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</span>" 17 And he took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "<span class="woc">Take this and divide it among yourselves.</span> 18 <span class="woc">For I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.</span>" 19 And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "<span class="woc">This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.</span>" 20 Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, "<span class="woc">This cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you.</span> 21 <span class="woc">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</span> 22 <span class="woc">And truly the Son of man goes as it was determined. But woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!</span>" 23 And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who should do this thing.</p>

  <p>24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 25 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</span> 26 <span class="woc">But you shall not be this way. But he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who is chief, as he who serves.</span> 27 <span class="woc">For which is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? But I am among you as he who serves.</span></p>

  <p>28 "<span class="woc">You are those who have continued with me in my temptations.</span> 29 <span class="woc">And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me,</span> 30 <span class="woc">So that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span>"</p>

  <p>31 And the Lord said, "<span class="woc">Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you so that he may sift you as wheat.</span> 32 <span class="woc">But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. When you are converted, strengthen your brothers.</span>" 33 And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both into prison and to death." 34 And he said, "<span class="woc">I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.</span>"</p>

  <p>35 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">When I sent you without purse, sack, and shoes, did you lack anything?</span>" And they said, "Nothing." 36 Then he said to them, "<span class="woc">But now he who has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his sack. And he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</span> 37 <span class="woc">For I say to you, that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me: '<cite>And he was reckoned among the transgressors.</cite>' For the things concerning me have an end.</span>" 38 And they said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords." And he said to them, "<span class="woc">It is enough.</span>"</p>

  <p>39 And he came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him. 40 And when he was at the place, he said to them, "<span class="woc">Pray so that you do not enter into temptation.</span>" 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's cast, knelt down, and prayed, 42 Saying, "<span class="woc">Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done.</span>" 43 And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. 44 And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly. And his sweat was like great drops of blood falling to the ground. 45 And when he arose from prayer and had come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 46 And said to them, "<span class="woc">Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.</span>"</p>

  <p>47 And while he was yet speaking, behold a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. 48 But Jesus said to him, "<span class="woc">Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?</span>" 49 When those who were around him saw what would follow, they said to him, "Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. 51 And Jesus answered and said, "<span class="woc">Allow me to do this.</span>" And he touched his ear and healed him. 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, "<span class="woc">Have you come out as against a thief with swords and staffs?</span> 53 <span class="woc">When I was daily with you in the temple, you stretched forth no hands against me. But this is your hour and the power of darkness.</span>"</p>

  <p>54 Then they took him, led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance. 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and had sat down together, Peter sat down among them. 56 But a certain woman-servant beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him, and said, "This man was also with him." 57 And he denied him, saying, "Woman, I do not know him." 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, "You are also one of them." And Peter said, "Man, I am not." 59 And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, "In truth this man was also with him, for he is a Galilean." 60 And Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you say." And immediately, while he was yet speaking, the cock crowed. 61 And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." 62 And Peter went out and wept bitterly.</p>

  <p>63 And the men who held Jesus mocked him and smote him. 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, saying, "Prophesy. Who is he who smote you?" 65 And many other things they blasphemously spoke against him.</p>

  <p>66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes came together and led him into their council, 67 Saying, "Are you the Christ? Tell us." And he said to them, "<span class="woc">If I tell you, you will not believe.</span> 68 <span class="woc">And if I also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> 69 <span class="woc">Hereafter, the Son of man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span>" 70 Then they all said, "Are you then the Son of God?" And he said to them, "<span class="woc">You say that I am.</span>" 71 And they said, "What need do we have of any further testimony? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth."</p>
