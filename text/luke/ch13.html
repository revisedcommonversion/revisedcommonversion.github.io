    <p class="ch-outline">Christ preaches repentance upon the punishment of the Galileans and others, 1-5. The fruitless fig-tree may not stand, 6-9. He heals the crooked woman, 10-17; shows the powerful working of the word in the hearts of his chosen by the parable of the grain of mustard seed and of leaven, 18-21; exhorts to enter in at the strait gate, 22-30; and reproves Herod and Jerusalem, 31-35.</p><!--outline-->

  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 There were present at that season some who told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">Do you suppose that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans because they suffered such things?</span> 3 <span class="woc">I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</span> 4 <span class="woc">Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were sinners above all men who dwelt in Jerusalem?</span> 5 <span class="woc">I tell you, no, but unless you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</span>"</p>

  <p>6 He also spoke this parable: "<span class="woc">A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit on it, and found none.</span> 7 <span class="woc">Then he said to the dresser of his vineyard, 'Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none. Cut it down. Why does it encumber the ground?'</span> 8 <span class="woc">And he, answering, said to him, 'Lord, leave it alone this year also until I dig around it and fertilize it.</span> 9 <span class="woc">And if it bears fruit, fine. But if not, then after that you shall cut it down.'</span>"</p>

  <p>10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. 11 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no way raise herself. 12 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, "<span class="woc">Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.</span>" 13 And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorified God. 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said to the people, "There are six days in which men ought to work; therefore, come on those days and be healed, and not on the sabbath." 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, "<span class="woc">You hypocrite. Does each one of you on the sabbath not untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead him away to watering?</span> 16 <span class="woc">And ought this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound these eighteen years, not be released from this bond on the Sabbath?</span>" 17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed. And all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>

  <p>18 Then he said, "<span class="woc">To what is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</span> 19 <span class="woc">It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and cast into his garden, and it grew and became a great tree and the '<cite>birds of the air lodged in its branches.</cite>'</span>"</p>

  <p>20 And again he said, "<span class="woc">To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> 21 <span class="woc">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</span>"</p>

  <p>22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 23 Then someone said to him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" And he said to them, 24 "<span class="woc">Strive to enter in at the narrow gate. For I say to you, many will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</span> 25 <span class="woc">When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us,' he will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'</span> 26 <span class="woc">Then you will begin to say, 'We have eaten and drank in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.'</span> 27 <span class="woc">But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you are from. "<cite>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.</cite>"'</span> 28 <span class="woc">There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves excluded.</span> 29 <span class="woc">And they will come from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south and will sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> 30 <span class="woc">And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span>"</p>

  <p>31 The same day there came some of the Pharisees, saying to him, "Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill you." 32 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and I do cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected.</span> 33 <span class="woc">Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.'</span> 34 <span class="woc">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you! How often I would have gathered your children as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</span> 35 <span class="woc">Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And truly I say to you, you shall not see me until the time comes when you say, '<cite>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</cite>'</span>"</p>
