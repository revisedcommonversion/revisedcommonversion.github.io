  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Then all the tax collectors and sinners drew near to him to hear him. 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."</p>

  <p>3 And he spoke this parable to them, saying, 4 "<span class="woc">What man of you having one hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?</span> 5 <span class="woc">And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</span> 6 <span class="woc">And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.'</span> 7 <span class="woc">I say to you, that likewise, joy shall be in heaven over one sinner who repents, more than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.</span></p>

  <p>8 "<span class="woc">Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loses one piece, does not light a candle, sweep the house, and diligently seek until she finds it?</span> 9 <span class="woc">And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.'</span> 10 <span class="woc">Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.</span>"</p>

  <p>11 And he said, "<span class="woc">A certain man had two sons.</span> 12 <span class="woc">And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.' And he divided his living to them.</span> 13 <span class="woc">And not many days after, the younger son gathered everything together, took his journey into a far country, and wasted his substance there with riotous living.</span> 14 <span class="woc">And when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in need.</span> 15 <span class="woc">And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> 16 <span class="woc">And he would willingly have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate, and no man gave to him.</span> 17 <span class="woc">And when he came to himself, he said, 'How many hired servants of my father have bread enough to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!</span> 18 <span class="woc">I will arise and go to my father and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,</span> 19 <span class="woc">And am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants."'</span> 20 <span class="woc">And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, had compassion, ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</span> 21 <span class="woc">And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</span> 22 <span class="woc">But the father said to his servants, 'Bring forth the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.</span> 23 <span class="woc">And bring the fattened calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</span> 24 <span class="woc">For this son of mine was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.' And they began to be merry.</span></p>

  <p>25 "<span class="woc">Now his elder son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> 26 <span class="woc">And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span> 27 <span class="woc">And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him in health.'</span> 28 <span class="woc">And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore, his father came out and entreated him.</span> 29 <span class="woc">And he, answering, said to his father, 'Behold, these many years I have served you and I have never transgressed your commandment, and yet you never gave me a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.</span> 30 <span class="woc">But as soon as this son of yours had come, who has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed the fattened calf for him.'</span> 31 <span class="woc">And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me and all that I have is yours.</span> 32 <span class="woc">It was proper that we should make merry and be glad. For this brother of yours was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.'</span>"</p>
