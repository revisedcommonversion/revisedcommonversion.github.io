  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 And it came to pass, that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 2 And saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. 3 And he entered into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people out of the boat. 4 Now when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "<span class="woc">Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.</span>" 5 And Simon, answering, said to him, "Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing. Nevertheless, at your word I will let down the net." 6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their net broke. 7 And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink. 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." 9 For he was astonished, along with all who were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken, 10 And so were James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "<span class="woc">Do not fear. From now on you shall catch men.</span>" 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed him.</p>

  <p>12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold, a man full of leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, fell on his face and implored him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." 13 And he put forth his hand and touched him, saying, "<span class="woc">I am willing. Be clean.</span>" And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 14 And he charged him, "<span class="woc">Tell no man. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them.</span>" 15 But so much the more a fame of him went abroad, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed.</p>

  <p>17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them. 18 And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed. And they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him. 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went upon the house-top and let him down through the tiling with his bed into the midst before Jesus. 20 And when he saw their faith, he said to him, "<span class="woc">Man, your sins are forgiven.</span>" 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he, answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">What do you reason in your hearts?</span> 23 <span class="woc">Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?</span> 24 <span class="woc">But so that you may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins</span>"—he said to the paralytic—"<span class="woc">I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go into your house.</span>" 25 And immediately he arose before them, took up that on which he lay, and departed to his own house glorifying God. 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen strange things today."</p>

  <p>27 And after these things, he went forth and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the receipt of custom. And he said to him, "<span class="woc">Follow me.</span>" 28 And he left everything, arose, and followed him.</p>

  <p>29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house, and there was a great company of tax collectors and of others who sat down with them. 30 But the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?" 31 And Jesus, answering, said to them, "<span class="woc">Those who are well do not need a physician, but those who are sick do.</span> 32 <span class="woc">I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</span>"</p>

  <p>33 And they said to him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?" 34 And he said to them, "<span class="woc">Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> 35 <span class="woc">But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span>" 36 And he also spoke a parable to them: "<span class="woc">No man puts a patch of a new garment upon an old, or else the new makes a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old.</span> 37 <span class="woc">And no man puts new wine into old bottles, or else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles will perish.</span> 38 <span class="woc">But new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span> 39 <span class="woc">No man also having drank old wine immediately desires new, because he says, 'The old is better.'</span>"</p>
