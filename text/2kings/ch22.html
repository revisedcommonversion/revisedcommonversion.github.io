  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD and walked in all the way of David his father and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</p>

  <p>3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 4 "Go to Hilkiah the high priest so that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people. 5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work who have the oversight of the house of the LORD, and let them give it to the doers of the work who are in the house of the LORD to repair the breaches of the house, 6 To carpenters, builders, and masons, and for buying timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 7 But there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully."</p>

  <p>8 And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD." And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said, "Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who have the oversight of the house of the LORD." 10 And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>

  <p>11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying, 13 "Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words of this book that is found, for the wrath of the LORD is great that is kindled against us because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book to do according to all that which is written concerning us."</p>

  <p>14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asahiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they communed with her. 15 And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Tell the man who sent you to me, 16 "Thus says the LORD: 'Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read. 17 Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched.'" 18 But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus you shall say to him: "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Concerning the words which you have heard, 19 Because your heart was tender and you have humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,' says the LORD. 20 'Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace. And your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.'"'" And they brought back word to the king.</p>
