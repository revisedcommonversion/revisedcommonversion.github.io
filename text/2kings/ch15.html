  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign. 2 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. 3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done, 4 Save that the high places were not removed. The people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places. 5 And the LORD smote the king so that he was a leper to the day of his death and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land. 6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 7 So Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>

  <p>8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months. 9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin. 10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, smote him before the people, slew him, and reigned in his stead. 11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 12 This was the word of the LORD which he spoke to Jehu, saying, "Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." And so it came to pass.</p>

  <p>13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned a full month in Samaria. 14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, slew him, and reigned in his stead. 15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah and all who were in it and its borders from Tirzah because they did not open to him; therefore, he smote it, and all the women in it who were with child he ripped up.</p>

  <p>17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin.</p>

  <p>19 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land. And Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver so that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land. 21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 22 And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

  <p>23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. 24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin. 25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh and with him fifty men of the Gileadites. And he killed him and reigned in his stead. 26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>

  <p>27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. 28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. He did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin.</p>

  <p>29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, came and took Ijon, Abel-beth-maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, smote him, slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>

  <p>32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign. 33 He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD. He did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 35 Yet the high places were not removed. The people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. 36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 37 In those days the LORD began to send Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah. 38 And Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
