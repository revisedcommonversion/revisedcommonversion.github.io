  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When either man or woman separates themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves to the LORD, 3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist or dried grapes. 4 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.</p>

  <p>5 'All the days of the vow of his separation no razor shall come upon his head. Until the days are fulfilled in which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.</p>

  <p>6 'All the days that he separates himself to the LORD, he shall come near to no dead body. 7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his God is upon his head. 8 All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.</p>

  <p>9 'And if any man dies very suddenly by him and he has defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he shall shave it. 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 11 And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same day. 12 And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering. But the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiled.</p>

  <p>13 'And this is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled. He shall be brought to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 14 And he shall offer his offering to the LORD: one male lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, one ram without blemish for peace-offerings, 15 A basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their food-offering and their drink-offerings. 16 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD and offer his sin-offering and his burnt-offering. 17 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer his food-offering and his drink-offering. 18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation and take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings. 19 And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer and put them upon the hands of the Nazarite after the hair of his separation is shaved. 20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD. This is the holy portion for the priest, with the wave-breast and heave-shoulder. And after that, the Nazarite may drink wine.'</p>

  <p>21 "This is the law of the Nazarite who has vowed and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides that which his hand shall get. According to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation."</p>

  <p>22 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 23 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'In this way you shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,</p>

  <p>24 "May the LORD bless you and keep you.</p>

  <p>25 May the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.</p>

  <p>26 May the LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace."'</p>

  <p>27 "And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them."</p>
