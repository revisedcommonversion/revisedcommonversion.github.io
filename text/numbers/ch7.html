  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, had anointed it, and sanctified it and all its instruments—both the altar and all its vessels—and had anointed them and sanctified them, 2 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes and were over those who were numbered, offered. 3 And they brought their offering before the LORD: six covered wagons and twelve oxen—a wagon for two of the princes and for each one an ox. And they brought them before the tabernacle. 4 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 5 "Take it from them so that they may be used to perform the service of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and you shall give them to the Levites, to each according to his service." 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon according to their service. 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.</p>

  <p>10 And the princes offered for dedicating the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. 11 And the LORD said to Moses, "They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar."</p>

  <p>12 And he who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah. 13 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight of which was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a food-offering; 14 One spoon of ten shekels of gold, full of incense; 15 One young bull, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt-offering; 16 One kid of the goats for a sin-offering; 17 And for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five lambs of the first year. This was the offering of Nahshon the son of Amminadab.</p>

  <p>18 On the second day Nethaneel the son of Zuar, prince of Issachar, offered. 19 He offered for his offering one silver charger, the weight of which was one hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a food-offering; 20 One spoon of gold of ten shekels, full of incense; 21 One young bull, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt-offering; 22 One kid of the goats for a sin-offering; 23 And for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five lambs of the first year.
