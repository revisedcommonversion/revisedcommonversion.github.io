  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman. 2 And they said, "Has the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? Has he not spoken also by us?" And the LORD heard it. 3 (Now the man Moses was very meek above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.) 4 And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, "Come out, you three, to the Tabernacle of the Congregation." And the three of them came out. 5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forth.</p>

  <p>6 And he said, "Now hear my words. If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will make myself known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream.</p>

  <p>7 "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.</p>

  <p>8 With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even apparently and not in dark speeches, and the similitude of the LORD he shall behold. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"</p>

  <p>9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them and he departed. 10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle, and behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. 11 And Aaron said to Moses, "Alas, my lord, I implore you, do not lay the sin upon us in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned. 12 Do not let her be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth." 13 And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, "Heal her now, O God, I implore you." 14 And the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received again." 15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days. And the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again.</p>

  <p>16 And afterward the people departed from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
