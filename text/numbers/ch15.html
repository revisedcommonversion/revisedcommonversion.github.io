  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land of your habitations which I give to you, 3 And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, a sacrifice in performing a vow, in a voluntary-offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, of the herd or of the flock, 4 Then he who offers his offering to the LORD shall bring a food-offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil. 5 And the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering you shall prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice for one lamb. 6 Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a food-offering two tenth parts of flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil. 7 And for a drink-offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine for a sweet savor to the LORD. 8 And when you prepare a bull for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace-offerings to the LORD, 9 You shall bring with a bull a food-offering of three tenth parts of flour mingled with half a hin of oil. 10 And you shall bring for a drink-offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD.</p>

  <p>11 'Thus it shall be done for one bull, for one ram, for a lamb, or a kid. 12 According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number. 13 All who are born in the country shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD.</p>

  <p>14 'And if a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever is among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD, he shall do as you do. 15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger who sojourns with you, an ordinance forever in your generations. As you are, so the stranger shall be before the LORD. 16 One law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.'"</p>

  <p>17 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 18 "Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, 'When you come into the land where I bring you, 19 It shall be, that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a heave-offering to the LORD. 20 You shall offer a cake of the first of your dough for a heave-offering. As you do the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so you shall heave it. 21 Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD a heave-offering in your generations.</p>

  <p>22 'And if you have erred and not observed all these commandments which the LORD has spoken to Moses, 23 Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses and from now on among your generations, 24 Then it shall be, if anything is committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt-offering for a sweet savor to the LORD, with his food-offering and his drink-offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering. 25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven, for it is ignorance. And they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their ignorance. 26 And all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and also the stranger who sojourns among them, seeing all the people were in ignorance.</p>

  <p>27 'And if any soul sins through ignorance, then he shall bring a female goat of the first year for a sin-offering. 28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul who sins ignorantly when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him. And he shall be forgiven. 29 You shall have one law for him who sins through ignorance, both for him who is born among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them. 30 But the soul who does anything presumptuously, whether he is born in the land or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 31 Because he has despised the word of the LORD and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off. His iniquity shall be upon him.'"</p>

  <p>32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man who gathered sticks upon the sabbath-day. 33 And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. 34 And they put him in custody because it was not declared what should be done to him. 35 And the LORD said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp." 36 And all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

  <p>37 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 38 "Speak to the children of Israel and bid them that they make themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a thread of blue. 39 And it shall be to you for a fringe, so that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the LORD and do them, and that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes after which you use to go astray, 40 And that you may remember and do all my commandments and be holy to your God. 41 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God."</p>
