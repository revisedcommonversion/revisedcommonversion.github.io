  <p>1 "'And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no servile work. It is a day of blowing the trumpets for you. 2 And you shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor to the LORD: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish; 3 And their food-offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth-parts for a bull, two tenth-parts for a ram, 4 And one tenth-part for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 5 And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, to make an atonement for you, 6 Besides the burnt-offering of the month and its food-offering, the daily burnt-offering and its food-offering, and their drink-offerings, according to their manner, for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.</p>

  <p>7 'And you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls. You shall not do any work. 8 But you shall offer a burnt-offering to the LORD for a sweet savor: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year—they shall be to you without blemish; 9 And their food-offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth-parts to a bull, two tenth-parts to one ram, 10 And a single tenth-part for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 11 One kid of the goats for a sin-offering, besides the sin-offering of atonement, the continual burnt-offering and its food-offering, and their drink-offerings.</p>

  <p>12 'And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no servile work and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days. 13 And you shall offer a burnt-offering, a sacrifice made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD: thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year—they shall be without blemish; 14 And their food-offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth-parts to every bull of the thirteen bulls, two tenth-parts to each ram of the two rams, 15 And a single tenth-part to each lamb of the fourteen lambs; 16 And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>17 'And on the second day you shall offer twelve young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot; 18 And their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 19 And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and their drink-offerings.</p>

  <p>20 'And on the third day eleven bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish; 21 And their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 22 And one goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>23 'And on the fourth day ten bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish; 24 Their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 25 And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>26 'And on the fifth day nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without spot; 27 And their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 28 And one goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>29 'And on the sixth day eight bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish; 30 And their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 31 And one goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>32 'And on the seventh day seven bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year without blemish; 33 And their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 34 And one goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>35 'On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly. You shall do no servile work. 36 But you shall offer a burnt-offering, a sacrifice made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD: one bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish; 37 Their food-offering and their drink-offerings for the bull, for the ram, and for the lambs shall be according to their number, after the manner; 38 And one goat for a sin-offering, besides the continual burnt-offering, its food-offering, and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>39 'These things you shall do to the LORD in your set feasts, besides your vows and your voluntary-offerings, for your burnt-offerings, for your food-offerings, for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.'" 40 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
