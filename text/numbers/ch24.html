  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him. 3 And he took up his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Balaam the son of Beor has said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the man whose eyes are open has said,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> He has said, who heard the words of God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who saw the vision of the Almighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> How beautiful your tents are, O Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your tabernacles, O Israel!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> As the valleys they are spread forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as gardens by the river's side,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the trees of lign-aloes which the LORD has planted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as cedar-trees beside the waters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He shall pour the water out of his buckets<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his seed shall be in many waters,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his king shall be higher than Agag<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> God brought him forth from Egypt.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has the strength as a wild ox.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall eat up the nations his enemies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall break their bones<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as a great lion. Who shall rouse him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Blessed is he who blesses you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and cursed is he who curses you."</p>
  </div>

  <p>10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam and he smote his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. 11 And now, flee to your place. I thought to promote you to great honor, but behold, the LORD has kept you back from honor." 12 And Balaam said to Balak, "Did I not speak also to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, 13 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD to do either good or bad of my own mind, but what the LORD says, that I will speak'? 14 And now, behold, I go to my people. Come therefore, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days."</p>

  <p>15 And he took up his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Balaam the son of Beor has said,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the man whose eyes are open has said,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He has said, who heard the words of God<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and knew the knowledge of the Most High,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who saw the vision of the Almighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I shall see him, but not now.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall behold him, but not near.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There shall come a Star out of Jacob,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall smite the corners of Moab<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and destroy all the children of Sheth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And Edom shall be a possession,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And Israel shall do valiantly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Out of Jacob shall come he who has dominion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall destroy him who remains of the city."</p>
  </div>

  <p>20 And when he looked at Amalek, he took up his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Amalek was the first of the nations,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his latter end shall be that he shall perish forever."</p>
  </div>

  <p>21 And he looked at the Kenites and took up his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Your dwelling-place is strong<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you put your nest in a rock.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />until Asher carries you away captive."</p>
  </div>

  <p>23 And he took up his parable and said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Alas! Who shall live when God does this?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall afflict Ashur and shall afflict Eber,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he also shall perish forever."</p>
  </div>

  <p>25 And Balaam arose and went and returned to his place. And Balak also went his way.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/numbers/MHC%20-%20Numbers%2C%20Chapter%2024.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Numbers, Chapter 24</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.7] - "seed" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "It is uncertain in what sense the word 'seed' issued. It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. Ecclesiastes 11:1), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (Isaiah 44:4). The former seems most in keeping here."</p>
