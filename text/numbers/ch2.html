  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2 "Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard with the ensign of their father's house. Far off around Tabernacle of the Congregation they shall pitch. 3 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun, those of the standard of the camp of Judah shall pitch throughout their armies, and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah. 4 And his host and those who were numbered of them were seventy-four thousand and six hundred. 5 And those who shall pitch next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar, and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of Issachar. 6 And his host and those who were numbered of it were fifty-four thousand and four hundred. 7 Then the tribe of Zebulun, and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun. 8 And his host and those who were numbered of it were fifty-seven thousand and four hundred. 9 All who were numbered in the camp of Judah were one hundred and eighty-six thousand and four hundred throughout their armies. These shall first move forward.</p>

  <p>10 "On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies, and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur. 11 And his host and those who were numbered of it were forty-six thousand and five hundred. 12 And those who pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon, and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 13 And his host and those who were numbered of them were fifty-nine thousand and three hundred. 14 Then the tribe of Gad, and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel. 15 And his host and those who were numbered of them were forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty. 16 All who were numbered in the camp of Reuben were one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty throughout their armies. And they shall move forward in the second rank.</p>

  <p>17 "Then the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall move forward with the camp of the Levites, in the midst of the camp. As they encamp, so they shall move forward, every man in his place by their standards.</p>

  <p>18 "On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies, and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud. 19 And his host and those who were numbered of them were forty thousand and five hundred. 20 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh, and the captain of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 21 And his host and those who were numbered of them were thirty-two thousand and two hundred. 22 Then the tribe of Benjamin, and the captain of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni. 23 And his host and those who were numbered of them were thirty-five thousand and four hundred. 24 All who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred and eight thousand and one hundred throughout their armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.</p>

  <p>25 "The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by their armies, and the captain of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 26 And his host and those who were numbered of them were sixty-two thousand and seven hundred. 27 And those who encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher, and the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran. 28 And his host and those who were numbered of them were forty-one thousand and five hundred. 29 Then the tribe of Naphtali, and the captain of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan. 30 And his host and those who were numbered of them were fifty-three thousand and four hundred. 31 All those who were numbered in the camp of Dan were one hundred and fifty-seven thousand and six hundred. They shall go hindmost with their standards."</p>

  <p>32 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers. All those who were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. 33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel as the LORD commanded Moses. 34 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. So they pitched by their standards and so they moved forward, each after their families, according to the house of their fathers.</p>
