  <p>1 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2 "Command the children of Israel and say to them, 'My offering and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire for a sweet savor to me, you shall observe to offer to me in their due season.' 3 And you shall say to them, 'This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD: two lambs of the first year without spot day by day for a continual burnt-offering, 4 One lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at evening; 5 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a food-offering, mingled with a fourth part of a hin of beaten oil— 6 It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained at mount Sinai for a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD; 7 And its drink-offering shall be the fourth part of a hin for one lamb—in the holy place you shall cause the strong wine to be poured to the LORD for a drink-offering; 8 And the other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the food-offering of the morning and as its drink-offering, you shall offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD.</p>

  <p>9 'And on the sabbath-day [you shall offer] two lambs of the first year without spot and two tenth-parts of flour for a food-offering mingled with oil and its drink-offering. 10 This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>11 'And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt-offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without spot; 12 Three tenth-parts of flour for a food-offering, mingled with oil, for one bull; two tenth-parts of flour for a food-offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; 13 And a single tenth-part of flour mingled with oil for a food-offering for one lamb, for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD. 14 And their drink-offering shall be half a hin of wine to a bull, the third part of a hin to a ram, and a fourth part of a hin to a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year. 15 And one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to the LORD shall be offered, besides the continual burnt-offering and its drink-offering.</p>

  <p>16 'And on the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD. 17 And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast. Seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten. 18 On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no manner of servile work. 19 But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt-offering to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year—they shall be to you without blemish; 20 And their food-offering shall be of flour mingled with oil; three tenth-parts you shall offer for a bull and two tenth-parts for a ram; 21 A single tenth-part you shall offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 22 And one goat for a sin-offering, to make an atonement for you. 23 You shall offer these besides the burnt-offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering. 24 After this manner you shall offer daily throughout the seven days the food of the sacrifice made by fire, a sweet savor to the LORD. It shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering and its drink-offering. 25 And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no servile work.</p>

  <p>26 'Also in the day of the first-fruits, when you bring a new food-offering to the LORD, after your weeks have ended, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no servile work. 27 But you shall offer the burnt-offering for a sweet savor to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; 28 And their food-offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth-parts to one bull, two tenth-parts to one ram, 29 A single tenth part to one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 30 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. 31 You shall offer them besides the continual burnt-offering and its food-offering (they shall be to you without blemish) and their drink-offerings.'"</p>
