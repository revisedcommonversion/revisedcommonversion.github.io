  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "He who is wounded or mutilated in his secrets shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 2 An illegitimate son shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. Even to his tenth generation he shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 3 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD. Even to their tenth generation they shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD forever, 4 Because they did not meet you with bread and with water in the way when you came forth from Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia to curse you. 5 Nevertheless, the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam, but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loved you. 6 You shall not seek their peace, nor their prosperity all your days forever.</p>

  <p>7 "You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land. 8 The children who are begotten by them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.</p>

  <p>9 "When the host goes forth against your enemies, keep yourself from every wicked thing.</p>

  <p>10 "If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of uncleanness that happens to him by night, then he shall go abroad out of the camp. He shall not come within the camp. 11 But it shall be, when evening comes near, he shall wash himself with water, and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.</p>

  <p>12 "You shall have a place also outside the camp where you shall go forth abroad. 13 And you shall have a paddle upon your weapon, and it shall be when you relieve yourself abroad, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you. 14 For the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to give up your enemies before you; therefore, your camp shall be holy, so that he may see no unclean thing in you and turn away from you.</p>

  <p>15 "You shall not deliver to his master the servant who has escaped from his master to you. 16 He shall dwell with you, even among you in that place which he chooses in one of your gates where it pleases him best. You shall not oppress him.</p>

  <p>17 "There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, nor a temple prostitute of the sons of Israel. 18 You shall not bring the wages of a harlot, or the price of a dog into the house of the LORD your God for any vow, for even both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>19 "You shall not lend upon interest to your brother: interest of money, interest of food, or interest of anything that is lent upon interest. 20 To a stranger you may lend upon interest, but to your brother you shall not lend upon interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land where you go to possess it.</p>

  <p>21 "When you vow a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not defer to pay it, for the LORD your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin in you. 22 But if you forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you. 23 That which is uttered by your lips you shall keep and perform, even a voluntary-offering, according as you have vowed to the LORD your God, which you have promised with your mouth.</p>

  <p>24 "When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, you may satisfy your appetite with grapes at your own pleasure, but you shall not put any in your vessel.</p>

  <p>25 "When you come into the standing grain of your neighbor, you may pluck the heads with your hand, but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain."</p>
