  <p>1 And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death:</p>

  <p>2 And he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The LORD came from Sinai, <br />and rose up from Seir to them. <br />He shined forth from mount Paran, <br />and he came with tens of thousands of saints. <br />From his right hand went a fiery law for them.</p>

    <p>3&emsp;Indeed, he loved the people. <br />All his saints are in your hand, <br />and they sat down at your feet. <br />Each receives your words.</p>

    <p>4&emsp;Moses commanded us a law, <br />even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>

    <p>5&emsp;And he was king in Jeshurun <br />when the heads of the people <br />and the tribes of Israel were assembled.</p>

    <p>6&emsp;"Let Reuben live, and not die, <br />and do not let his men be few."</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 And this is the blessing of Judah:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, <br />and bring him to his people. <br />Let his hands be sufficient for him. <br />May you be a help to him from his enemies."</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 And of Levi he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, <br />whom you proved at Massah <br />and with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah,</p>

    <p>9&emsp;Who said to his father and to his mother, <br />'I have not seen him,' <br />neither did he acknowledge his brothers, <br />nor know his own children, <br />for they have observed your word and kept your covenant.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;They shall teach Jacob your judgments <br />and Israel your law. <br />They shall put incense before you <br />and whole burnt sacrifice upon your altar.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;Bless, LORD, his substance, <br />and accept the work of his hands. <br />Smite through the loins of those who rise against him <br />and of those who hate him, so that they do not rise again."</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 And of Benjamin he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him, <br />and the LORD shall cover him all day long, <br />and he shall dwell between his shoulders."</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 And of Joseph he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Blessed of the LORD be his land <br />for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, <br />for the deep that couches beneath,</p>

    <p>14&emsp;For the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, <br />for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>

    <p>15&emsp;For the chief things of the ancient mountains, <br />for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>

    <p>16&emsp;For the precious things of the earth and its fullness, <br />and for the good will of him who dwelt in the bush. <br />Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph <br />and upon the top of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;His glory is like the first-born of his bull, <br />and his horns are like the horns of wild oxen. <br />With them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth. <br />And they are the tens of thousands of Ephraim, <br />and they are the thousands of Manasseh."</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 And of Zebulun he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, <br />and Issachar, in your tents.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;They shall call the people to the mountain. <br />There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness, <br />for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas <br />and of treasures hid in the sand."</p>
  </div>

  <p>20 And of Gad he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Blessed is he who enlarges Gad. <br />He dwells as a lion <br />and tears the arm with the crown of the head.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;And he provided the first part for himself, <br />because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, he was seated. <br />And he came with the heads of the people. <br />He executed the justice of the LORD <br />and his judgments with Israel."</p>
  </div>

  <p>22 And of Dan he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Dan is a lion's whelp. <br />He shall leap from Bashan."</p>
  </div>

  <p>23 And of Naphtali he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"O Naphtali, satisfied with favor <br />and full with the blessing of the LORD, <br />possess the west and the south."</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 And of Asher he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Let Asher be blessed with children. <br />Let him be acceptable to his brothers, <br />and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Your shoes shall be iron and brass. <br />And as your days, so your strength shall be.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;"There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, <br />who rides upon the heaven to your help <br />and in his excellence on the sky.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;The eternal God is your refuge, <br />and underneath are the everlasting arms. <br />And he shall thrust out the enemy from before you, <br />and shall say, 'Destroy them.'</p>

    <p>28&emsp;Israel then shall dwell in safety alone. <br />The fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of grain and wine. <br />His heavens shall also drop down dew.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;Happy are you, O Israel! <br />Who is like you, O people saved by the LORD, <br />the shield of your help, <br />and he who is the sword of your excellence? <br />And your enemies shall be found liars to you, <br />and you shall tread upon their high places."</p>
