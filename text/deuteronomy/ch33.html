  <p>1 And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death: 2 And he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The LORD came from Sinai,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rose up from Seir to them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shined forth from mount Paran,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he came with tens of thousands of saints.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />From his right hand went a fiery law for them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Indeed, he loved the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All his saints are in your hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they sat down at your feet.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Each receives your words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Moses commanded us a law,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> And he was king in Jeshurun<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when the heads of the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the tribes of Israel were assembled.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> "Let Reuben live, and not die,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let his men be few."</p>
  </div>

  <p>7 And this is the blessing of Judah:</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and bring him to his people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let his hands be sufficient for him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />May you be a help to him from his enemies."</p>
  </div>

  <p>8 And of Levi he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom you proved at Massah<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Who said to his father and to his mother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />'I have not seen him,'<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither did he acknowledge his brothers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor know his own children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they have observed your word<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and kept your covenant.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> They shall teach Jacob your judgments<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Israel your law.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall put incense before you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whole burnt sacrifice upon your altar.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Bless, LORD, his substance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and accept the work of his hands.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Smite through the loins of those who rise against him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of those who hate him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that they do not rise again."</p>
  </div>

  <p>12 And of Benjamin he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD shall cover him all day long,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he shall dwell between his shoulders."</p>
  </div>

  <p>13 And of Joseph he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Blessed of the LORD be his land<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the precious things of heaven, for the dew,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the deep that couches beneath,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> For the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> For the chief things of the ancient mountains,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For the precious things of the earth and its fullness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for the good will of him who dwelt in the bush.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and upon the top of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> His glory is like the first-born of his bull,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his horns are like the horns of wild oxen.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With them he shall push the people together<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the ends of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And they are the tens of thousands of Ephraim,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and they are the thousands of Manasseh."</p>
  </div>

  <p>18 And of Zebulun he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and Issachar, in your tents.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> They shall call the people to the mountain.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of treasures hid in the sand."</p>
  </div>

  <p>20 And of Gad he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Blessed is he who enlarges Gad.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He dwells as a lion<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and tears the arm with the crown of the head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> And he provided the first part for himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, he was seated.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he came with the heads of the people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He executed the justice of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his judgments with Israel."</p>
  </div>

  <p>22 And of Dan he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Dan is a lion's whelp.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall leap from Bashan."</p>
  </div>

  <p>23 And of Naphtali he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"O Naphtali, satisfied with favor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and full with the blessing of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />possess the west and the south."</p>
  </div>

  <p>24 And of Asher he said,</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p class="in-verse">"Let Asher be blessed with children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let him be acceptable to his brothers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Your shoes shall be iron and brass.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And as your days, so your strength shall be.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> "There is no one like the God of Jeshurun,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who rides upon the heaven to your help<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in his excellence on the sky.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> The eternal God is your refuge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and underneath are the everlasting arms.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he shall thrust out the enemy from before you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall say, 'Destroy them.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Israel then shall dwell in safety alone.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of grain and wine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His heavens shall also drop down dew.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Happy are you, O Israel!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who is like you, O people saved by the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the shield of your help,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who is the sword of your excellence?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And your enemies shall be found liars to you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you shall tread upon their high places."</p>
