  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> "Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> My doctrine shall drop as the rain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my speech shall distill as the dew,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as the small rain upon the tender herb,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as the showers upon the grass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> For I will publish the name of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ascribe greatness to our God.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> "He is the Rock, his work is perfect,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for all his ways are judgment.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A God of truth and without iniquity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is just and right.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> They have corrupted themselves.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their spot is not the spot of his children.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Is he not your Father who has bought you?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Has he not made you and established you?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Remember the days of old,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />consider the years of many generations.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Ask your father, and he will declare to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />[Ask] your elders, and they will tell you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he separated the sons of Adam,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he set the bounds of the people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For the LORD'S portion is his people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> "He found him in a desert land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in the barren, howling wilderness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He led him around, he instructed him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> As an eagle stirs up her nest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />flutters over her young,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />spreads abroad her wings, takes them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />bears them on her wings,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> So the LORD alone led him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there was no strange god with him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of the earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He ate the increase of the fields.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He nourished him with honey out of the rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and oil out of the flinty rock,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> With butter of cows, and milk of sheep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with fat of lambs,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rams of the breed of Bashan and goats,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the finest of the wheat.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And you drank the pure blood of the grape.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> "But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />You have waxed fat, you have grown thick, you are covered with fatness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Then he forsook God who made him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With abominations they provoked him to anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> They sacrificed to devils, not to God,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to gods which they did not know,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to new gods who came newly up,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom your fathers did not fear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have forgotten God who formed you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> "And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> And he said, 'I will hide my face from them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will see what their end will be,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are a very perverse generation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />children in whom there is no faith.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For a fire is kindled in my anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall burn to the lowest hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />consume the earth with her increase,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> 'I will heap mischiefs upon them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will spend my arrows upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> They shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with bitter destruction.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The sword outside and terror inside,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the nursing child also with the man of gray hairs.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> I said, "I would scatter them into corners<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I would make their remembrance to cease from among men,"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lest they should say, "Our hand is high,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD has not done all this."'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> "For they are a nation void of counsel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither is there any understanding in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> O that they were wise, that they understood this,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that they would consider their latter end!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> How should one chase a thousand<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and two put ten thousand to flight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />unless their Rock had sold them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD had shut them up?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even our enemies themselves being judges.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and of the fields of Gomorrah.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their grapes are grapes of gall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their clusters are bitter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Their wine is the poison of serpents<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the cruel venom of asps.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> "Is this not laid up in store with me<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and sealed up among my treasures?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> To me belongs vengeance and recompense.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Their foot shall slide in due time,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the day of their calamity is at hand,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> For the LORD shall judge his people<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and have compassion on his servants<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he sees that their power is gone<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no one shut up or left.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">37</span> And he shall say, 'Where are their gods,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />their rock in whom they trusted,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">38</span> Which ate the fat of their sacrifices<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drank the wine of their drink-offerings?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let them rise up and help you<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be your protection.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">39</span> 'See now that I, even I am he,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is no god with me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I kill and I make alive.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I wound and I heal.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">40</span> For I lift up my hand to heaven,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and say, "I live forever."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">41</span> If I whet my glittering sword<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my hand takes hold of judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will render vengeance to my enemies<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will recompense those who hate me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">42</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my sword shall devour flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.'</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">43</span> "Rejoice, O nations, with his people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he will avenge the blood of his servants,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will render vengeance to his adversaries,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will be merciful to his land and to his people."</p>

  <p>44 And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people—he and Joshua the son of Nun. 45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel, 46 And he said to them, "Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 47 For it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."</p>

  <p>48 And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying, 49 "Ascend this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho, and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a possession, 50 And die on the mountain where you go and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on mount Hor and was gathered to his people, 51 Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel. 52 Yet you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there to the land which I give the children of Israel."</p>
