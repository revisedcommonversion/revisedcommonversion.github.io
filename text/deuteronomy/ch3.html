  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against us—he and all his people—to battle at Edrei. 2 And the LORD said to me, 'Do not fear him, for I will deliver him, all his people, and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.' 3 So the LORD our God also delivered into our hands Og the king of Bashan and all his people. And we smote him until no one was left to him remaining. 4 And we took all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5 All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides unwalled towns a great number. 6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city. 7 But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for plunder for ourselves.</p>

  <p>8 "And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of the Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon 9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Shenir), 10 All the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits was its length and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.</p>

  <p>12 "And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the Arnon River, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of Rephaim. 14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri and Maachathi, and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day. 15 And I gave Gilead to Machir. 16 And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the Arnon River half the valley, and the border even to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the children of Ammon, 17 And also the plain, and the Jordan, and its coast, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the Salt Sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</p>

  <p>18 "And I commanded you at that time, saying, 'The LORD your God has given you this land to possess it. You shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all who are suitable for the war. 19 But your wives, your little ones, and your cattle (for I know that you have many cattle) shall abide in your cities which I have given you, 20 Until the LORD has given rest to your brothers, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan. And then you shall each return to his possession which I have given you.' 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, 'Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. Thus the LORD shall do to all the kingdoms where you pass. 22 You shall not fear them, for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.'</p>

  <p>23 "And I implored the LORD at that time, saying, 24 'O Lord GOD, you have begun to show your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth who can do according to your works and according to your might? 25 I pray you, let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that good mountain, and Lebanon.' 26 But the LORD was angry with me for your sakes and would not hear me. And the LORD said to me, 'Let it suffice you. Speak no more to me of this matter. 27 Ascend to the top of Pisgah and lift up your eyes westward, northward, southward, and eastward, and behold with your eyes, for you shall not go over this Jordan. 28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him and strengthen him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.' 29 So we stayed in the valley over against Beth-peor."</p>
