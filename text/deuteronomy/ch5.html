  <p>1 And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, so that you may learn them and observe to do them. 2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 3 The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. 4 The LORD talked with you face to face on the mountain, from the midst of the fire 5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time to show you the word of the LORD, for you were afraid by reason of the fire and did not go up upon the mountain), saying,</p>

  <p>6 'I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.</p>

  <p>7 'You shall have no other gods before me.</p>

  <p>8 'You shall not make for yourself any engraved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth. 9 You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 10 And showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>

  <p>11 'You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p>

  <p>12 'Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you. 13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 14 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall not do any work—you, your son, your daughter, your man-servant, your woman-servant, your ox, your donkey, any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates—so that your man-servant and your woman-servant may rest as well as you. 15 And remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm; therefore, the LORD your God commanded you to keep the sabbath-day.</p>

  <p>16 'Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days may be prolonged and that it may be well with you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.</p>

  <p>17 'You shall not kill.</p>

  <p>18 'You shall not commit adultery.</p>

  <p>19 'You shall not steal.</p>

  <p>20 'You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</p>

  <p>21 'You shall not desire your neighbor's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbor's house, his field, his man-servant, his woman-servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.'</p>

  <p>22 "These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mountain from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness with a great voice, and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and delivered them to me. 23 And it came to pass, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness (for the mountain burned with fire), that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes and your elders, 24 And you said, 'Behold, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God talks with man, and he lives. 25 Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the LORD our God anymore, then we shall die. 26 For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 27 Go near, and hear all that the LORD our God says, and speak to us all that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will hear it and do it.'</p>

  <p>28 "And the LORD heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, 'I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have well said all that they have spoken. 29 O that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always, so that it might be well with them and with their children forever! 30 Go, say to them, "Return to your tents again." 31 But as for you, stand here by me and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, so that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. 32 You shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 33 You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess."</p>
