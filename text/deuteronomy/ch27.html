  <p>1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, "Keep all the commandments which I command you this day. 2 And it shall be on the day when you pass over the Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones and plaster them with plaster. 3 And you shall write upon them all the words of this law when you have passed over, so that you may enter in to the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you. 4 Therefore, it shall be, when you have gone over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones which I command you this day on mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster. 5 And there you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You shall not lift up any iron tool upon them. 6 You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones. And you shall offer on it burnt-offerings to the LORD your God. 7 And you shall offer peace-offerings, and shall eat there and rejoice before the LORD your God. 8 And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly."</p>

  <p>9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, "Take heed and listen, O Israel, this day you have become the people of the LORD your God. 10 You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and do his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day."</p>

  <p>11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 12 "These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have come over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 14 And the Levites shall speak, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,</p>

  <p>15 'Cursed is the man who makes any engraved or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place.' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>16 'Cursed is he who sets light by his father or his mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>17 'Cursed is he who removes his neighbor's landmark.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>18 'Cursed is he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>19 'Cursed is he who perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>20 'Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he uncovers his father's skirt.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>21 'Cursed is he who lies with any manner of beast.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>22 'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>23 'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>24 'Cursed is he who smites his neighbor secretly.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>25 'Cursed is he who takes reward to slay an innocent person.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'</p>

  <p>26 'Cursed is he who does not confirm all the words of this law to do them.' And all the people shall say, 'Amen.'"</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oF8k9NuS7qOZqBOkKPU4O63g7SOOJs-W-agvCNmvJj8" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Deuteronomy, Chapter 27</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.16] - "sets light" - This phrase means, "does not view as important." A synonym would be, trifling, which means, "Being of small value or importance; trivial; paltry." So, to rephrase this verse, it would read as, "Cursed is he who views his father or his mother as trifling."</p>
  <p>[v.26] - Quoted in Galatians 3:10.</p>
