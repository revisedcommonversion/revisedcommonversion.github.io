  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Hew two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me upon the mountain and make an ark of wood. 2 And I will write on the tablets the words that were in the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.' 3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and ascended the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. 4 And he wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which the LORD spoke to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me. 5 And I turned myself and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made. And they are there, as the LORD commanded me."</p>

  <p>6 "And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jakan to Mosira. Aaron died there, and he was buried there. And Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. 7 From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. 9 Therefore, Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.</p>

  <p>10 "And I stayed on the mountain, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights. And the LORD listened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you. 11 And the LORD said to me, 'Arise, take your journey before the people so that they may go in and possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.'</p>

  <p>12 "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 13 And to keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good? 14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongs to the LORD your God, and also the earth, with all that it contains. 15 Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their posterity after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. 16 Therefore, circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no longer. 17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, a great, a mighty, and an awesome God, who does not regard persons nor take reward. 18 He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and he loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. 19 Therefore, love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 20 You shall fear the LORD your God and you shall serve him. You shall cleave to him and swear by his name. 21 He is your praise and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen. 22 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons, and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude."</p>
