  <p>1 "All the commandments which I command you this day you shall observe to do, so that you may live, multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers. 2 And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. 3 And he humbled you and allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, neither did your fathers know, so that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD. 4 Your clothing has not become old upon you, neither has your foot swelled these forty years. 5 You shall also consider in your heart, that as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you. 6 Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in his ways and to fear him. 7 For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 8 A land of wheat, barley, vines, fig-trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive-oil and honey; 9 A land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you may dig brass. 10 When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.</p>

  <p>11 "Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God, in not keeping his commandments, his judgments, and his statutes which I command you this day, 12 Lest, when you have eaten and are full and have built good houses and dwelt in them, 13 And when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold are increased, and all that you have is increased, 14 Your heart be lifted up and you forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, 15 Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, in which there were fiery serpents, scorpions, and drought, where there was no water, who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint, 16 Who fed you in the wilderness with manna which your fathers did not know, so that he might humble you and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end. 17 And you shall say in your heart, 'My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.' 18 But you shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, so that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day. 19 And it shall be, if you at all forget the LORD your God, walk after other gods, serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish. 20 As the nations which the LORD destroys before your face, so you shall perish, because you would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God."</p>
