  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 "When a man has taken a wife and married her, and it comes to pass that she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her, let him write her a bill of divorcement, give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 2 And when she has departed from his house, she may go and be another man's wife. 3 And if the latter husband hates her and writes her a bill of divorcement, gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife, 4 Her former husband who sent her away may not take her again to be his wife, since she is defiled, for that is abomination before the LORD. And you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.</p>

  <p>5 "When a man has newly taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business, but he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer his wife which he has taken.</p>

  <p>6 "No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone for a pledge, for he takes a man's life for a pledge.</p>

  <p>7 "If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel and makes merchandise of him or sells him, then that thief shall die, and you shall remove evil from among you.</p>

  <p>8 "Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently and do according to all that the priests the Levites teach you. As I commanded them, so you shall observe to do. 9 Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam by the way after you came forth from Egypt.</p>

  <p>10 "When you lend your brother anything, you shall not go into his house to take his pledge. 11 You shall stand abroad, and the man to whom you lend shall bring out the pledge abroad to you. 12 And if the man is poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge. 13 In any case you shall deliver to him the pledge again when the sun goes down, so that he may sleep in his own clothing, and bless you. And it shall be righteousness for you before the LORD your God.</p>

  <p>14 "You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is of your brothers, or of your strangers who are in your land within your gates. 15 At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it, for he is poor and sets his heart upon it, lest he should cry against you to the LORD and it be sin to you.</p>

  <p>16 "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>

  <p>17 "You shall not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless, nor take a widow's clothing for a pledge. 18 But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from there. Therefore, I command you to do this thing.</p>

  <p>19 "When you cut down your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to fetch it. It shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 20 When you beat your olive-tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p>

  <p>21 "When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward. It shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 22 And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore, I command you to do this thing."</p>
