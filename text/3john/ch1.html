  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 The elder to the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth:</p>

  <p>2 Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers. 3 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth. 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>

  <p>5 Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers and to strangers, 6 Who have borne testimony of your charity before the church, whom, if you shall bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you will do well, 7 Because for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing from the Gentiles. 8 We therefore ought to receive such so that we may be fellow-helpers for the truth.</p>

  <p>9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the pre-eminence among them, does not receive us. 10 Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brothers and forbids those who would and casts them out of the church.</p>

  <p>11 Beloved, do not follow that which is evil, but that which is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God. 12 Demetrius has good report by all men and by the truth itself. And we also bear testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</p>

  <p>13 I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with ink and pen.</p>

  <p>14 But I trust I shall see you shortly and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.</p>
