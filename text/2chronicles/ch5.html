  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated. And the silver, the gold, and all the instruments he put among the treasures of the house of God.</p>

  <p>2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion. 3 Therefore, all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month. 4 And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark. 5 And they brought up the ark, the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought these up. 6 Also king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled to him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim, 8 For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staffs above. 9 And they drew out the staffs of the ark so that the ends of the staffs were seen from the ark before the oracle, but they were not seen outside. And it is there to this day. 10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put in it at Horeb when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt.</p>

  <p>11 And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present were sanctified, and did not keep their courses, 12 And also the Levites who were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets), 13 It even came to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music and praised the LORD, saying, "For he is good, for his mercy endures forever," that the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD, 14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</p>
