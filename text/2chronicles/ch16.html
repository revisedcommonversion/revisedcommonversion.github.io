  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came against Judah and built Ramah so that he might let no one go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 2 Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying, 3 "There is a league between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel so that he may depart from me." 4 And Ben-hadad listened to king Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. And they smote Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. 5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off the building of Ramah and let his work cease. 6 Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha was building, and he built with it Geba and Mizpah.</p>

  <p>7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Syria and have not relied on the LORD your God, therefore the host of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand. 8 Were the Cushites and the Lubims not a numerous army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand. 9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him. In this you have done foolishly. Therefore, from now on you shall have wars." 10 Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in a prison house, for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</p>

  <p>11 And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 12 And Asa in the thirty-ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceedingly severe. Yet in his disease he did not seek the LORD, but the physicians. 13 And Asa slept with his fathers and died in the forty-first year of his reign. 14 And they buried him in his own sepulchers which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and diverse kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art. And they made a very great burning for him.</p>
