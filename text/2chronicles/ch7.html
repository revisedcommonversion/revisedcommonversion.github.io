  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices. And the glory of the LORD filled the house. 2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house. 3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, worshiped, and praised the LORD, saying, "For he is good, for his mercy endures forever."</p>

  <p>4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. 5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 6 And the priests waited on their offices, the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures forever, when David praised by their ministry. And the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</p>

  <p>7 Moreover, Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings, the food-offerings, and the fat.</p>

  <p>8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt. 9 And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly, for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days. 10 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</p>

  <p>11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD and the king's house. And all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</p>

  <p>12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night and said to him, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. 13 If I shut up heaven so that there is no rain, if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, 14 If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 15 Now my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. 16 For now I have chosen and sanctified this house so that my name may be there forever. And my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. 17 And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you and observe my statutes and my judgments, 18 Then I will establish the throne of your kingdom according as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, 'There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.'</p>

  <p>19 "But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, 20 Then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them. And this house, which I have sanctified for my name, I will cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a by-word among all nations. 21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to everyone who passes by it, so that he shall say, 'Why has the LORD done so to this land and to this house?' 22 And it shall be answered, 'Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold upon other gods, worshiped them, and served them, therefore he has brought all this evil upon them.'"</p>
