  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Moreover, he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length, twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height. 2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits was its height, and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it. 3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which encompassed it, ten in a cubit, encompassing the sea. Two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast. 4 It stood upon twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set above upon them, and all their hindquarters were inward. 5 And its thickness was a hand-breadth and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies, and it received and held three thousand baths. 6 He also made ten basins and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them. Such things as they offered for the burnt-offering they washed in them. But the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p>

  <p>7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple: five on the right hand and five on the left. 8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple: five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold. 9 Furthermore, he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with brass. 10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</p>

  <p>11 And Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God, 12 Namely, the two pillars, the bowls, the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars, 13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths, two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the pillars. 14 He also made bases and made basins upon the bases, 15 One sea and twelve oxen under it. 16 The pots also, the shovels, the flesh-hooks, and all their instruments, Huram his chief workman made for king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. 17 In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. 18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the weight of the brass could not be ascertained.</p>

  <p>19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God: the golden altar and the tables on which the show-bread was set; 20 Moreover, the candlesticks with their lamps (that they should burn after the manner before the oracle) of pure gold; 21 And the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, he made of gold (and that of perfect gold); 22 And the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold; and the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold.</p>
