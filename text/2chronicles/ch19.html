  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 2 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king Jehoshaphat, "Should you help the ungodly and love those who hate the LORD? Therefore, wrath is upon you from before the LORD. 3 Nevertheless, there are good things found in you, in that you have taken away the groves out of the land and have prepared your heart to seek God."</p>

  <p>4 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem. And he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers.</p>

  <p>5 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 6 And said to the judges, "Take heed what you do, for you do not judge for man, but for the LORD who is with you in the judgment. 7 Now therefore, let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Take heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts."</p>

  <p>8 Moreover, in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites, priests, and chief of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of the LORD and for controversies when they returned to Jerusalem. 9 And he charged them, saying, "Thus you shall do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully and with a perfect heart. 10 And whatever cause comes to you of your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you shall even warn them that they do not trespass against the LORD so that wrath may not come upon you and upon your brothers. Do this and you shall not trespass. 11 And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters. Also, the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD will be with the good."</p>
