  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba. 2 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3 And Jehoiada took for himself two wives and he begot sons and daughters.</p>

  <p>4 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. 5 And he convened the priests and the Levites and said to them, "Go out to the cities of Judah and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you hasten the matter." But the Levites did not hasten it. 6 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief and said to him, "Why have you not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?" 7 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God, and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD they bestowed upon Baalim.</p>

  <p>8 And at the king's commandment they made a chest and set it outside at the gate of the house of the LORD. 9 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness. 10 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, brought in, and cast into the chest until they had made an end. 11 Now it came to pass, that at the time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day and collected money in abundance. 12 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also those who wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. 13 Thus the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state and strengthened it. 14 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister and to offer with, and spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p>

  <p>15 But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days when he died. He was one hundred and thirty years old when he died. 16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward his house.</p>

  <p>17 Now after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and made obeisance to the king. Then the king listened to them. 18 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers and served groves and idols. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for their trespass. 19 Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the LORD. And they testified against them, but they would not give ear.</p>

  <p>20 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, "Thus says God: 'Why do you transgress the commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.'" 21 And they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 22 Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, "May the LORD look upon it and require it."</p>

  <p>23 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of Syria came up against him. And they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. 24 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment against Joash.</p>

  <p>25 And when they had departed from him (for they left him in great diseases), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the sepulchers of the kings. 26 And these are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess. 27 Now concerning his sons, the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
