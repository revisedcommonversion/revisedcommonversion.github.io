  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>

  <p>2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God. 3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places, broke down the images, cut down the groves, 4 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment. 5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images. And the kingdom was quiet before him. 6 And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest. And he had no war in those years because the LORD had given him rest. 7 Therefore, he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and make about them walls, towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered. 8 And Asa had an army of men who bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, who bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand. All these were mighty men of valor.</p>

  <p>9 And Zerah the Cushite came out against them with a host of one million, and also three hundred chariots, and came to Mareshah. 10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathath at Mareshah. 11 And Asa cried to the LORD his God and said, "LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with those who have no power. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God. Do not let man prevail against you." 12 So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa and before Judah, and the Cushites fled. 13 And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. And the Cushites were overthrown so that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before the LORD and before his host. And they carried away very much spoil. 14 And they smote all the cities about Gerar, for the fear of the LORD came upon them. And they plundered all the cities, for there was an abundance of spoil in them. 15 They also smote the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
