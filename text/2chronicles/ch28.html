    <h3>Chapter 28</h3>
    <p class="ch-outline">Ahaz, reigning very wickedly, is greatly afflicted by the Syrians, 1-5. Judah, being captivated by the Israelites, is sent home by the counsel of Oded the prophet, 6-15.

  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. But he did not do that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father, 2 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten images for Baalim. 3 Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 4 He also sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.</p>

  <p>5 Therefore, the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. 6 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, who were all valiant men, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. 7 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.</p>

  <p>8 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away a large amount of plunder from them and brought the plunder to Samaria. 9 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded, and he went out before the army that came to Samaria and said to them, "Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage that reaches to heaven. 10 And now you purpose to subdue the children of Judah and Jerusalem for men-servants and women-servants to you. But are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 11 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives back which you have taken captive of your brothers, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you." 12 Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war. 13 And said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here. For whereas we have offended against the LORD already, you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass, for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against Israel." 14 So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the congregation. 15 And the men who were expressed by name arose, took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked among them and arrayed them, shod them, gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.</p>

  <p>16 At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. 17 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah and carried away captives. 18 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, Ajalon, Gederoth, Shocho with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages, and they dwelt there. 19 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he made Judah naked and greatly transgressed against the LORD. 20 And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, but did not strengthen him. 21 For Ahaz took away a portion from the house of the LORD and from the house of the king and of the princes and gave it to the king of Assyria, but he did not help him.</p>

  <p>22 And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the LORD—this same king Ahaz. 23 For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him, and he said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me." But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. 24 And Ahaz collected the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God. And he shut up the doors of the house of the LORD and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25 And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. 26 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 27 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
