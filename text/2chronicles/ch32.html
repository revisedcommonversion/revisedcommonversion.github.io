  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 After these things and their establishment, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, entered into Judah, encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself. 2 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 3 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were outside the city. And they helped him. 4 So there were many people assembled who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?" 5 He also strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, built another wall outside, repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. 6 And he set captains of war over the people, assembled them to him in the street of the gate of the city, and encouraged them, saying, 7 "Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him, for there are more with us than with him. 8 With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>

  <p>9 After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him) against Hezekiah king of Judah and against all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, 10 "Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: 'On what do you trust that you abide in the siege in Jerusalem? 11 Does Hezekiah not persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, "The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria"? 12 Has the same Hezekiah not taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, "You shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it"? 13 Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the people of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand? 14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed who could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand? 15 Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him. For no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?'"</p>

  <p>16 And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah. 17 He also wrote letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel and to speak against him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand." 18 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall to terrify them and to fill them with consternation so that they might take the city. 19 And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of man.</p>

  <p>20 And for this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven. 21 And the LORD sent an angel who cut off all the mighty men of valor and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, those who came forth from his own body slew him there with the sword. 22 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others and guided them on every side. 23 And many brought gifts to the LORD in Jerusalem and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that from thereafter he was magnified in the sight of all nations.</p>

  <p>24 In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the LORD. And he spoke to him and gave him a sign. 25 But Hezekiah did not render again according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was lifted up. Therefore, there was wrath upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 26 However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p>

  <p>27 And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels, 28 And also store-houses for the increase of grain, wine, and oil, and stalls for all manner of beasts, and folds for flocks. 29 Moreover, he provided for himself cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him substance in great abundance. 30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 31 But, in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to try him so that he might know all that was in his heart.</p>

  <p>32 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p>
