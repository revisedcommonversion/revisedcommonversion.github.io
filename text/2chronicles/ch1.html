  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and magnified him exceedingly.</p>

  <p>2 Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. 3 So Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God was there, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. 4 But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 5 Moreover, the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the congregation sought for it. 6 And Solomon went up there to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and offered one thousand burnt-offerings upon it.</p>

  <p>7 In that night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."</p>

  <p>8 And Solomon said to God, "You have shown great mercy to David my father and have made me to reign in his stead. 9 Now, O LORD God, let your promise to David my father be established, for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 10 Now give me wisdom and knowledge so that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can judge this your great people?" 11 And God said to Solomon, "Because this was in your heart and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of your enemies, neither yet have asked for long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself so that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, 12 Wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. And I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, neither shall there any after you have the like." 13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and reigned over Israel.</p>

  <p>14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had one thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees he made as the sycamore trees that are in the valley for abundance. 16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn. The king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 17 And they fetched up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty. And so they brought out horses for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria by their means.</p>
