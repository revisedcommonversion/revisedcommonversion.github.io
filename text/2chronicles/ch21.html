  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 2 And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he gave to Jehoram because he was the first-born.</p>

  <p>4 Now when Jehoram had risen to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and slew all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel. 5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 6 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab for a wife. And he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. 7 Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever.</p>

  <p>8 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah and made themselves a king. 9 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and smote the Edomites who encompassed him and the captains of the chariots. 10 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. At the same time Libnah also revolted from under his hand because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 11 Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah to do the same.</p>

  <p>12 And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, "Thus says the LORD God of David your father: 'Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 13 But have walked in the way of the kings of Israel and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit idolatry, like the idolatries of the house of Ahab, and also have slain your brothers of your father's house, who were better than yourself, 14 Behold, with a great plague the LORD will smite your people, your children, your wives, and all your goods. 15 And you shall have great sickness by disease of your bowels until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.'"</p>

  <p>16 Moreover, the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians, who were near the Cushites. 17 And they came up into Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him, save Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</p>

  <p>18 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 19 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness. Thus he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 20 He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired. Yet they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2] - "Azariahu" - From Matthew Poole's Commentary: "Two sons called by the same name, though doubtless distinguished by some additional title, which is not mentioned here, because it did not concern succeeding ages to know it. Though indeed there is a difference in their Hebrew names, the one being Azariah, the other Azariahu, <span class="it">hu</span> being the last syllabic in his name, as in Elihu and others."</p>
