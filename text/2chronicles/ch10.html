  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it, who was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, that Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 3 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 4 "Your father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore, somewhat ease the grievous servitude of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you." 5 And he said to them, "Come back to me after three days." And the people departed.</p>

  <p>6 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, "What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?" 7 And they spoke to him, saying, "If you will be kind to this people, please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever." 8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who were brought up with him, who stood before him. 9 And he said to them, "What advice do you give that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, 'Ease somewhat the yoke that your father put upon us'?" 10 And the young men who were brought up with him spoke to him, saying, "Thus&nbsp;you&nbsp;shall answer the people who spoke to you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it somewhat lighter for us,' thus you shall say to them: 'My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins. 11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"</p>

  <p>12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day as the king directed, saying, "Come to me again on the third day." 13 And the king answered them roughly. And king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 14 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, "My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions." 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for the cause was of God so that the LORD might perform his word which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

  <p>16 And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, "What portion do we have in David? And we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel. And now, David, see to your own house." So all Israel went to their tents.</p>

  <p>17 But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 18 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram who was over the tribute. And the children of Israel stoned him with stones so that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get into his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</p>
