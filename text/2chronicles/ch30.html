  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel. 2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 3 For they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people assembled themselves at Jerusalem. 4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. 5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem, for they had not done it for a long time in the manner as it was written. 6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, "Children of Israel, turn back to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. 7 And do not be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as you see. 8 Now do not be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD and enter into his sanctuary which he has sanctified forever, and serve the LORD your God so that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. 9 For if you turn back to the LORD, your brothers and your children will find compassion before those who lead them captive so that they will return into this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if you return to him."</p>

  <p>10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them. 11 Nevertheless, some of Asher, Manasseh, and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 The hand of God was also in Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the LORD.</p>

  <p>13 And many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away and cast them into the brook Kidron. 15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD. 16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites. 17 For there were many in the congregation who were not sanctified; therefore, the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for everyone who was not clean to sanctify them to the LORD. 18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover in a way other than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the good LORD pardon everyone, 19 Who prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary." 20 And the LORD listened to Hezekiah and healed the people. 21 And the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD. 22 And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites who taught the good knowledge of the LORD. And they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace-offerings and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.</p>

  <p>23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days. And they kept the seven days with gladness. 24 For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave to the congregation one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation who came out of Israel, and the strangers who came from the land of Israel, and who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like it in Jerusalem. 27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. And their voice was heard and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling-place, even to heaven.</p>
