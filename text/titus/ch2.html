  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 But speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. 2 The aged men are to be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 3 The aged women likewise are to be in behavior as is appropriate for holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things, 4 So that they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers of the home, good, obedient to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed. 6 Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded. 7 In all things show yourself a pattern of good works. In your doctrine show integrity, gravity, sincerity, 8 Sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say concerning you.</p>

  <p>9 Exhort servants to be obedient to their own masters and to please them well in all things, not talking back, 10 Not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</p>

  <p>11 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, 12 Teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and piously in this present age, 13 Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, 14 Who gave himself for us so that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>

  <p>15 Speak these things, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.</p>
