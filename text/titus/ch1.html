  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is according to godliness, 2 In hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, 3 But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior,</p>

  <p>4 To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>

  <p>5 For this cause I left you in Crete: that you should set in order the things that are lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I had appointed you, 6 If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or disorderly. 7 For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God, not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not given to filthy lucre, 8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate, 9 Holding firm to the faithful word as he has been taught, so that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convict the gainsayers.</p>

  <p>10 For there are many disorderly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision. 11 Their mouths must be stopped, seeing that they subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not for the sake of sordid gain. 12 One of their own, even a prophet of their own, said, "The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons." 13 This testimony is true; therefore, rebuke them sharply so that they may be sound in the faith, 14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth. 15 To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 16 They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://personal.onlyoffice.com/Products/Files/DocEditor.aspx?fileid=3895205&doc=V2xUVGNHUjJEdEpvYU9iVFZmMmoyUFcrcWxpYUVpZ2ZDTWY4cEtJWWpqcz0_IjM4OTUyMDUi0" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Titus, Chapter 1</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>[v.2a] - "who cannot lie" - Reference, 1st Samuel 15:29.</p>
  <p>[v.2b] - "promised before the world began" - Reference, Romans 16:25. From Matthew Henry's Commentary: "But how is he said to promise before the world began? Answer, By promise some understand his decree: he purposed it in his eternal counsels, which were as it were his promise in embryo: or rather, say some, pro chronoµn aioµnioµn is before ancient times, or many years ago, referring to the promise darkly delivered, Genesis 3:15. Here is the stability and antiquity of the promise of eternal life to the saints. God, who cannot lie, hath promised before the world began, that is, many ages since. How excellent then is the gospel, which was the matter of divine promise so early! how much to be esteemed by us, and what thanks due for our privilege beyond those before us!"</p>
  <p>[v.3] - "through preaching" - Reference, Romans 10:17.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - "bishop" - A bishop is also known as an elder.</p>
  <p>[v.9] - "convict" - That is, to convince of sin; to prove or determine to be guilty, as by the conscience.</p>
  <p>[v.11] - "sordid gain" - Or, "filthy lucre."</p>
  <p>[v.12] - "gluttons" - Literally, "stomachs," that is, a man who is all stomach, or a glutton (Thayer's Greek Lexicon).</p>
  <p>[v.16] - "worthless for" - Or, "a reprobate to."</p>
