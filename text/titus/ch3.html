  <!--chapter text-->
  <p>1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready for every good work, 2 To speak evil of no man, to not be brawlers, but gentle, showing all meekness to all men. 3 For we ourselves were also sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 So that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I wish that you affirm constantly so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men. 9 But avoid foolish questions, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain. 10 Reject a man who is a heretic after the first and second admonition, 11 Knowing that he who is such is perverted and sins, being self-condemned.</p>

  <p>12 When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. 13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently so that nothing may be lacking for them. 14 And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses so that they may not be unfruitful.</p>

  <p>15 All who are with me salute you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
