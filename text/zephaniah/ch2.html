  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <span class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary</span>
  <p>In this chapter the prophet exhorts the Jews to repentance; and foretells the destruction of several neighboring nations. The body of the people of the Jews in general are first called upon to gather together and humble themselves, who were a people neither desirable, nor deserving of the favors of God, nor desirous of them (verse 1), and to this they are pressed, from the consideration of God's decree of vengeance being ready to bring forth and break forth upon them (verse 2), and then the few godly among them are exhorted to seek the Lord, and what is agreeable to him; since there was at least a probability of their being protected by him in a time of general calamity (verse 3), and that the destruction of this people might appear the more certain, and that they might have no dependence on their neighbors, the prophet proceeds to predict the ruin of several of them, particularly the Philistines; several places belonging to them are by name mentioned, and the whole land threatened with desolation; the maritime part of it to be only inhabited by shepherds and their flocks; and afterward the coast possessed by the Jews, on their return from their captivity (verses 4-7). Next the Moabites and Ammonites are prophesied of; whose destruction should come upon them for their pride, and for their contempt and reviling of the people of God; and which should be like that of Sodom and Gomorrah; and would issue in the abolition of idolatry, and the setting up of the worship of God in their country, and elsewhere (verses 8-11). As for the Ethiopians, they should be slain with the sword (verse 12), and the whole monarchy of Assyria, with Nineveh the metropolis of it, should be utterly laid waste, and become a desolation, and a wilderness; and the habitation, not only of flocks, but of beasts and birds of prey (verses 13-15).</p>
  <p>[v.6] - "cottages" - The Hebrew word here has been rendered in various ways. Common renderings are cottages, meadows, wells, or caves. John Owen, the Pulpit Commentary, and the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary rendered the Hebrew word, <span class="gr=heb">כרת</span>> (kaw-rawt'), as "to dig," or, "diggings," and said that this refers to either caves dug out by the shepherds to dwell in for shelter, or cisterns or wells dug out to water the flocks. The Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon supports the rendering of the word as, "cisterns," but also states that the text is dubious.</p>
