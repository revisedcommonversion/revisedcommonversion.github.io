  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging, and whoever is deceived by it is not wise.</p>

  <p>2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion. Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own soul.</p>

  <p>3 It is an honor for a man to cease from strife, but every fool will be meddling.</p>

  <p>4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore, he shall beg in harvest and have nothing.</p>

  <p>5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>

  <p>6 Most men will each proclaim his own goodness, but who can find a faithful man?</p>

  <p>7 The just man walks in his integrity. His children are blessed after him.</p>

  <p>8 A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.</p>

  <p>9 Who can say, "I have made my heart clean. I am pure from my sin"?</p>

  <p>10 Diverse weights and diverse measures, both of them are alike abominations to the LORD.</p>

  <p>11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work is pure and whether it is right.</p>

  <p>12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the LORD has made even both of them.</p>

  <p>13 Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty. Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.</p>

  <p>14 "It is nothing, it is nothing," says the buyer, but when he is gone, then he boasts.</p>

  <p>15 There is gold and a multitude of rubies, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>

  <p>16 Take his garment who is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

  <p>17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>

  <p>18 Every purpose is established by counsel, and with good advice make war.</p>

  <p>19 He who goes about as a gossiper reveals secrets; therefore, do not meddle with him who flatters with his lips.</p>

  <p>20 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p>

  <p>21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning, but its end shall not be blessed.</p>

  <p>22 Do not say, "I will recompense evil." But wait on the LORD, and he shall save you.</p>

  <p>23 Diverse weights are an abomination to the LORD, and a false balance is not good.</p>

  <p>24 Man's goings are of the LORD. How can a man then understand his own way?</p>

  <p>25 It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy, and later vows to make inquiry.</p>

  <p>26 A wise king scatters the wicked, and brings the wheel over them.</p>

  <p>27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</p>

  <p>28 Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is upheld by mercy.</p>

  <p>29 The glory of young men is their strength, and the beauty of old men is the gray head.</p>

  <p>30 The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil, and so do stripes to the inward parts of the belly.</p>
