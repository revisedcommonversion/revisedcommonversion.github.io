  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whoever is deceived by it is not wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own soul.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> It is an honor for a man to cease from strife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but every fool will be meddling.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, he shall beg in harvest and have nothing.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Most men will each proclaim his own goodness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but who can find a faithful man?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The just man walks in his integrity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His children are blessed after him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> A king who sits on the throne of judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />scatters away all evil with his eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Who can say, "I have made my heart clean.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am pure from my sin"?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Diverse weights and diverse measures,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />both of them are alike abominations to the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Even a child is known by his doings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whether his work is pure and whether it is right.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The hearing ear and the seeing eye,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD has made even both of them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Do not love sleep, lest you come to poverty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "It is nothing, it is nothing," says the buyer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when he is gone, then he boasts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> There is gold and a multitude of rubies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Take his garment who is surety for a stranger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Bread of deceit is sweet to a man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but afterward his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Every purpose is established by counsel,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with good advice make war.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He who goes around as a gossiper reveals secrets;<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />therefore, do not meddle with him who flatters with his lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Whoever curses his father or his mother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but its end shall not be blessed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Do not say, "I will recompense evil."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But wait on the LORD, and he shall save you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Diverse weights are an abomination to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a false balance is not good.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Man's goings are of the LORD.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How can a man then understand his own way?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and later vows to make inquiry.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> A wise king scatters the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and brings the wheel over them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />searching all the inward parts of the belly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Mercy and truth preserve the king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his throne is upheld by mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> The glory of young men is their strength,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the beauty of old men is the gray head.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> The blueness of a wound cleanses away evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so do stripes to the inward parts of the belly.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2020.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 20</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Reference, Deuteronomy 25:13-14; Proverbs 11:1.</p>
