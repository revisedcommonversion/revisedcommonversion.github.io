  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Do not boast yourself of tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.</p>

  <p>2 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth, a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>

  <p>3 A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.</p>

  <p>4 Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous, but who is able to stand before envy?</p>

  <p>5 Open rebuke is better than secret love.</p>

  <p>6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>

  <p>7 The full soul loathes a honey-comb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>

  <p>8 As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his place.</p>

  <p>9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, and so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</p>

  <p>10 Your own friend and your father's friend, do not forsake, neither go into your brother's house in the day of your calamity, for better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far off.</p>

  <p>11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, so that I may answer him who reproaches me.</p>

  <p>12 A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.</p>

  <p>13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

  <p>14 He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>

  <p>15 A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>

  <p>16 Whoever hides her has hidden the wind and has grasped ointment with his right hand.</p>

  <p>17 As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.</p>

  <p>18 He who keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit, and he who guards his master shall be honored.</p>

  <p>19 As in water face reflects face, so the heart of man to man.</p>

  <p>20 Hell and destruction are never full, and the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>

  <p>21 As the refining-pot for silver and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise.</p>

  <p>22 Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet his foolishness will not depart from him.</p>

  <p>23 Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, and look well to your herds,</p>

  <p>24 For riches are not forever. And does the crown endure to every generation?</p>

  <p>25 When the grass is removed, and the tender grass shows itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered,</p>

  <p>26 The lambs will be for your clothing, and the goats the price of a field.</p>

  <p>27 And you shall have enough goats' milk for your food, for the food of your household, and for sustenance for your young women.</p>
