  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Do not boast yourself of tomorrow,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for you do not know what a day may bring forth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A stone is heavy and the sand weighty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but who is able to stand before envy?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Open rebuke is better<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than secret love.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Faithful are the wounds of a friend,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The full soul loathes a honey-comb,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> As a bird that wanders from her nest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a man who wanders from his place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so does the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Your own friend and your father's friend, do not forsake,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither go into your brother's house in the day of your calamity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that I may answer him who reproaches me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the simple pass on and are punished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> He who blesses his friend with a loud voice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />rising early in the morning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> A continual dropping on a very rainy day<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a contentious woman are alike.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Whoever hides her has hidden the wind<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and has grasped ointment with his right hand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> As iron sharpens iron,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He who keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who guards his master shall be honored.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> As in water face reflects face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so the heart of man to man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Hell and destruction are never full,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> As the refining-pot for silver and the furnace for gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a man to his praise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet his foolishness will not depart from him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Be diligent to know the state of your flocks,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and look well to your herds,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> For riches are not forever.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And does the crown endure to every generation?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> When the grass is removed, and the tender grass shows itself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and herbs of the mountains are gathered,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> The lambs will be for your clothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the goats the price of a field.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> And you shall have enough goats' milk for your food,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the food of your household,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and for sustenance for your young women.</p>
