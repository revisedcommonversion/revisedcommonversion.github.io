  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 A wise son hears his father's instruction, but a scorner does not hear rebuke.</p>

  <p>2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth, but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.</p>

  <p>3 He who keeps his mouth keeps his life, but he who opens his lips wide shall have destruction.</p>

  <p>4 The soul of the sluggard desires, yet has nothing, but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.</p>

  <p>5 A righteous man hates lying, but a wicked man is loathsome and comes to shame.</p>

  <p>6 Righteousness keeps him who is upright in the way, but wickedness overthrows the sinner.</p>

  <p>7 There is one who makes himself rich, yet has nothing. There is one who makes himself poor, yet has great riches.</p>

  <p>8 The ransom of a man's life is his riches, but the poor does not hear rebuke.</p>

  <p>9 The light of the righteous rejoices, but the lamp of the wicked shall be extinguished.</p>

  <p>10 Only by pride comes contention, but with the well-advised is wisdom.</p>

  <p>11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished, but he who gathers by labor shall increase.</p>

  <p>12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.</p>

  <p>13 Whoever despises the word shall be destroyed, but he who fears the commandment shall be rewarded.</p>

  <p>14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>

  <p>15 Good understanding gives favor, but the way of transgressors is hard.</p>

  <p>16 Every prudent man deals with knowledge, but a fool lays open his folly.</p>

  <p>17 A wicked messenger falls into mischief, but a faithful ambassador is health.</p>

  <p>18 Poverty and shame shall be to him who refuses instruction, but he who regards reproof shall be honored.</p>

  <p>19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, but it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>

  <p>20 He who walks with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</p>

  <p>21 Evil pursues sinners, but to the righteous good shall be repaid.</p>

  <p>22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.</p>

  <p>23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor, but there is one who is destroyed for lack of judgment.</p>

  <p>24 He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who loves him chastens him diligently.</p>

  <p>25 The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul, but the belly of the wicked shall be lacking.</p>
