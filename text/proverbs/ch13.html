  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> A wise son hears his father's instruction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a scorner does not hear rebuke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> He who keeps his mouth keeps his life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who opens his lips wide shall have destruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> The soul of the sluggard desires, yet has nothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A righteous man hates lying,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a wicked man is loathsome and comes to shame.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Righteousness keeps him who is upright in the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but wickedness overthrows the sinner.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> There is one who makes himself rich, yet has nothing.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is one who makes himself poor, yet has great riches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The ransom of a man's life is his riches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the poor does not hear rebuke.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The light of the righteous rejoices,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the lamp of the wicked shall be extinguished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Only by pride comes contention,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but with the well-advised is wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who gathers by labor shall increase.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Hope deferred makes the heart sick,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Whoever despises the word shall be destroyed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who fears the commandment shall be rewarded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The law of the wise is a fountain of life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to depart from the snares of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Good understanding gives favor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the way of transgressors is hard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Every prudent man deals with knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a fool lays open his folly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> A wicked messenger falls into mischief,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a faithful ambassador is health.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Poverty and shame shall be to him who refuses instruction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who regards reproof shall be honored.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He who walks with wise men shall be wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Evil pursues sinners,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to the righteous good shall be repaid.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Much food is in the tillage of the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but there is one who is destroyed for lack of judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> He who spares his rod hates his son,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who loves him chastens him diligently.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the belly of the wicked shall be lacking.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2013.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 13</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
