  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD like channels of water.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He turns it wherever he pleases.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the LORD ponders the hearts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> To do justice and judgment<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> A high look and a proud heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which is the lamp of the wicked, is sin.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but of everyone who is hasty, only to poverty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is a vanity tossed to and fro by those who seek death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because they refuse to do judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Crooked is the way of a guilty man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but as for the pure, his work is right.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The soul of the wicked desires evil.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The righteous man wisely considers the house of the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but God overthrows the wicked for their wickedness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> A gift in secret pacifies anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a reward in the bosom, strong wrath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> It is joy to the just to do judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the transgressor for the upright.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> It is better to dwell in the wilderness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than with a contentious and an angry woman.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> There is a treasure to be desired, and oil in the dwelling of the wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a foolish man spends it up.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He who follows after righteousness and mercy<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />finds life, righteousness, and honor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> A wise man scales the city of the mighty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and casts down the strength of its confidence.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />keeps his soul from troubles.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The proud and haughty man, "Scoffer," is his name.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He works in the arrogance of pride.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The desire of the slothful kills him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for his hands refuse to labor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He covets greedily all the day long,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous gives and does not spare.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> A false witness shall perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the man who hears speaks constantly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> A wicked man hardens his face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but as for the upright, he directs his way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> There is no wisdom nor understanding<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor counsel against the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The horse is prepared for the day of battle,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but safety is from the LORD.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2021.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 21</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - "Crooked is the way of a guilty man" - From the Pulpit Commentary: "Both [the Latin Vulgate] and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In <span class="gr-heb">וזר</span>, translated 'and strange' (which seems to mean 'alien from what is right'), the <span class="it">vav</span> is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying 'laden with guilt,' so that the clause ought to be rendered, 'Crooked is the way of a guilty man.'" The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon agrees with this rendering.</p>
