  <p>1 [<span class="it">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy. The man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal.</span>]</p>

  <p>2 Surely I am more brutish than any man and do not have the understanding of a man.</p>

  <p>3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the Holy One.</p>

  <p>4 Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?</p>

  <p>5 Every word of God is pure. He is a shield to those who put their trust in him.</p>

  <p>6 Do not add to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</p>

  <p>7 Two things I have required of you, do not deny them to me before I die:</p>

  <p>8 Remove far from me vanity and lies, and give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with the food of my portion,</p>

  <p>9 Lest I be full and deny you, and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>

  <p>10 Do not accuse a servant to his master, lest he curse you and you be found guilty.</p>

  <p>11 There is a generation that curses their father and does not bless their mother.</p>

  <p>12 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes, but are not washed from their filthiness.</p>

  <p>13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.</p>

  <p>14 There is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw-teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men.</p>

  <p>15 The horse-leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give." There are three things that are never satisfied, even four things that do not say, "It is enough":</p>

  <p>16 The grave, the barren womb, the earth that is not filled with water, and the fire that does not say, "It is enough."</p>

  <p>17 The eye that mocks at its father and despises to obey its mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>

  <p>18 There are three things which are too wonderful for me, even four which I do not know:</p>

  <p>19 The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid.</p>

  <p>20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says, "I have done no wickedness."</p>

  <p>21 For three things the earth is disquieted, even for four which it cannot bear:</p>

  <p>22 A servant when he reigns, a fool when he is filled with food,</p>

  <p>23 An odious woman when she is married, and a handmaid who is heir to her mistress.</p>

  <p>24 There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are very wise:</p>

  <p>25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer,</p>

  <p>26 The conies are but a feeble people, yet they make their houses in the rocks,</p>

  <p>27 The locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth by bands,</p>

  <p>28 The spider takes hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</p>

  <p>29 There are three things which go well, even four are stately in going:</p>

  <p>30 A lion, which is strongest among beasts and does not turn away for any,</p>

  <p>31 A greyhound, a male goat, and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</p>

  <p>32 If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>

  <p>33 Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood, and the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2030.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 30</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>John Gill did not summarize this chapter in his exposition.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - "greyhound" - From John Gill's Exposition: "So Gersom interprets the word; but Jarchi owns he does not know what is meant; and Aben Ezra only says, it is the name of a living creature, but does not say what; but observes, that some interpret it of the "bee", and others of the "eagle". The words of the original text only describe something "girt about the loins": and Kimchi observes, that some say it is a hunting dog so called, because it is thin about the loins, as if it was bound and girt; and Aristotle describes hunting dogs as well girded about their loins: but others, as Kimchi in the same place observes, interpret it of the leopard, which is small, and strong in its loins; and others of a bird called the starling; but he owns he cannot understand the meaning of its loins being girt: David de Pomis interprets it of a cock; others, he says, interpret it a hunting dog; others, a leopard; and some, a species of an unclean bird; perhaps he means the starling, as before; and so the word is used for that bird in the Talmud, and in the Arabic language. Most likely the "horse" is meant; which is a very stately and majestic creature in its going, and is very comely when it has its harness girt on; and especially a war horse, with all its warlike accoutrements, when it proceeds to battle, and stalks on in it; this creature, one should think, could not be omitted among the four, which is described in so magnificent a manner in Job 39:19; and is called the goodly horse in the battle, Zechariah 10:3; unless a fine slender bodied race horse should be meant: the horse bids fairer than any other creature named to be what is designed." The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon also suggests either the greyhound or a war horse. The Pulpit commentary includes the zebra and the leopard, along with the war horse and greyhound, but is most in favor of the greyhound.</p>
