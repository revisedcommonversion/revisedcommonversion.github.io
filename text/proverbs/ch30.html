  <p>1 [<span class="it">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy. The man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>2&emsp; Surely I am more brutish than any man<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not have the understanding of a man.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; I neither learned wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor have the knowledge of the Holy One.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; Who has ascended into heaven, or descended?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has gathered the wind in his fists?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has bound the waters in a garment?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has established all the ends of the earth?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you can tell?</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Every word of God is pure.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He is a shield to those who put their trust in him.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Do not add to his words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Two things I have required of you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not deny them to me before I die:</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Keep vanity and lies far from me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and give me neither poverty nor riches.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Feed me with the food of my portion,</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Lest I be full and deny you, and say, "Who is the LORD?"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or lest I be poor and steal,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and take the name of my God in vain.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Do not accuse a servant to his master,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest he curse you and you be found guilty.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;There is a generation that curses their father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not bless their mother.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but are not washed from their filthiness.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes!<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And their eyelids are lifted up.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;There is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw-teeth as knives<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;The horse-leech has two daughters, crying, "Give, give."<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There are three things that are never satisfied,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even four things that do not say, "It is enough":</p>

    <p>16&emsp;The grave, the barren womb,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the earth that is not filled with water,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fire that does not say, "It is enough."</p>

    <p>17&emsp;The eye that mocks at its father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and despises to obey its mother,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the ravens of the valley shall pick it out<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;There are three things which are too wonderful for me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even four which I do not know:</p>

    <p>19&emsp;The way of an eagle in the air,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the way of a serpent upon a rock,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the way of a ship in the midst of the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the way of a man with a young woman.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Such is the way of an adulterous woman:<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />she eats and wipes her mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and says, "I have done no wickedness."</p>

    <p>21&emsp;For three things the earth is disquieted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even for four which it cannot bear:</p>

    <p>22&emsp;A servant when he reigns,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a fool when he is filled with food,</p>

    <p>23&emsp;An odious woman when she is married,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a woman-servant who is heir to her mistress.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;There are four things which are little upon the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but they are very wise:</p>

    <p>25&emsp;The ants are a people not strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they prepare their food in the summer,</p>

    <p>26&emsp;The conies are but a feeble people,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet they make their houses in the rocks,</p>

    <p>27&emsp;The locusts have no king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />yet all of them go forth by bands,</p>

    <p>28&emsp;The spider takes hold with her hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and is in kings' palaces.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;There are three things which go well,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even four are stately in going:</p>

    <p>30&emsp;A lion, which is strongest among beasts<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not turn away for any,</p>

    <p>31&emsp;A greyhound, a male goat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</p>

    <p>32&emsp;If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or if you have thought evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>

    <p>33&emsp;Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>John Gill did not summarize this chapter in his exposition.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - "greyhound" - From John Gill's Exposition: "So Gersom interprets the word; but Jarchi owns he does not know what is meant; and Aben Ezra only says, it is the name of a living creature, but does not say what; but observes, that some interpret it of the "bee", and others of the "eagle". The words of the original text only describe something "girt about the loins": and Kimchi observes, that some say it is a hunting dog so called, because it is thin about the loins, as if it was bound and girt; and Aristotle describes hunting dogs as well girded about their loins: but others, as Kimchi in the same place observes, interpret it of the leopard, which is small, and strong in its loins; and others of a bird called the starling; but he owns he cannot understand the meaning of its loins being girt: David de Pomis interprets it of a cock; others, he says, interpret it a hunting dog; others, a leopard; and some, a species of an unclean bird; perhaps he means the starling, as before; and so the word is used for that bird in the Talmud, and in the Arabic language. Most likely the "horse" is meant; which is a very stately and majestic creature in its going, and is very comely when it has its harness girt on; and especially a war horse, with all its warlike accoutrements, when it proceeds to battle, and stalks on in it; this creature, one should think, could not be omitted among the four, which is described in so magnificent a manner in Job 39:19; and is called the goodly horse in the battle, Zechariah 10:3; unless a fine slender bodied race horse should be meant: the horse bids fairer than any other creature named to be what is designed." The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon also suggests either the greyhound or a war horse. The Pulpit commentary includes the zebra and the leopard, along with the war horse and greyhound, but is most in favor of the greyhound.</p>
