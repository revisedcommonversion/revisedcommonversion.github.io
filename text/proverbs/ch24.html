  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Do not be envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them,</p>

  <p>2 For their heart devises destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>

  <p>3 Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established,</p>

  <p>4 And by knowledge the chambers shall be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>

  <p>5 A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge increases strength.</p>

  <p>6 For by wise counsel you shall make your war, and in multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>

  <p>7 Wisdom is too high for a fool. He does not open his mouth in the gate.</p>

  <p>8 He who devises to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</p>

  <p>9 The thought of foolishness is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to men.</p>

  <p>10 If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.</p>

  <p>11 Hold back and deliver those who are drawn to death, and those who are ready to be slain.</p>

  <p>12 If you say, "Behold, we did not know it," does he who ponders the heart not consider it? And he who keeps your soul, does he not know it? And will he not render to every man according to his works?</p>

  <p>13 My son, eat honey, because it is good, and the honey-comb, which is sweet to your taste.</p>

  <p>14 Thus shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul. When you have found it, there shall be a reward, and your expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

  <p>15 Do not lay in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous. Do not destroy his resting-place.</p>

  <p>16 For a just man falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>

  <p>17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles,</p>

  <p>18 Lest the LORD see it and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>

  <p>19 Do not fret yourself because of evil men, neither be envious of the wicked,</p>

  <p>20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man. The candle of the wicked shall be extinguished.</p>

  <p>21 My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not meddle with those who are given to change,</p>

  <p>22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly. And who knows the ruin of the both of them?</p>

  <p>23 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>

  <p>24 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous," the people shall curse him, nations shall abhor him.</p>

  <p>25 But to those who rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.</p>

  <p>26 Every man shall kiss his lips who gives a right answer.</p>

  <p>27 Prepare your work outside and make it fit for yourself in the field, and afterward build your house.</p>

  <p>28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.</p>

  <p>29 Do not say, "I will do so to him as he has done to me. I will render to the man according to his work."</p>

  <p>30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding,</p>

  <p>31 And behold, it was all grown over with thorns, nettles had covered its face, and its stone wall was broken down.</p>

  <p>32 Then I saw, and considered it well. I looked upon it, and received instruction.</p>

  <p>33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,</p>

  <p>34 And your poverty shall come as one who travels, and your need as an armed man.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2024.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 24</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Psalm 62:12; Matthew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Ephesians 6:8.</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Reference, Deuteronomy 16:19.</p>
