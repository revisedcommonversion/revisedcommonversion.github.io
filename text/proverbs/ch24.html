    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Do not be envious against evil men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither desire to be with them,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For their heart devises destruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their lips talk of mischief.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Through wisdom a house is built,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by understanding it is established,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> And by knowledge the chambers shall be filled<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A wise man is strong,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a man of knowledge increases strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For by wise counsel you shall make your war,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Wisdom is too high for a fool.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He does not open his mouth in the gate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He who devises to do evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall be called a mischievous person.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The thought of foolishness is sin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the scorner is an abomination to men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> If you faint in the day of adversity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />your strength is small.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Hold back and deliver those who are drawn to death<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who are ready to be slain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> If you say, "Behold, we did not know it,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />does he who ponders the heart not consider it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he who keeps your soul, does he not know it?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And will he not render to every man according to his works?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> My son, eat honey because it is good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the honey-comb which is sweet to your taste.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Thus shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When you have found it, there shall be a reward,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Do not lay in wait, O wicked man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />against the dwelling of the righteous.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not destroy his resting-place.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For a just man falls seven times and rises again,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Lest the LORD see it and it displease him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Do not fret yourself because of evil men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither be envious of the wicked,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> For there shall be no reward to the evil man.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The candle of the wicked shall be extinguished.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> My son, fear the LORD and the king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not meddle with those who are given to change,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For their calamity shall rise suddenly.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And who knows the ruin of the both of them?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> These things also belong to the wise.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the people shall curse him, nations shall abhor him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> But to those who rebuke him shall be delight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a good blessing shall come upon them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> Every man shall kiss his lips<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who gives a right answer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Prepare your work outside<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make it fit for yourself in the field,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and afterward, build your house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not deceive with your lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Do not say, "I will do so to him as he has done to me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will render to the man according to his work."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> I went by the field of the slothful<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> And behold, it was all grown over with thorns,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nettles had covered its face,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and its stone wall was broken down.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Then I saw and considered it well.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I looked upon it and received instruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a little folding of the hands to sleep,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> And your poverty shall come as one who travels,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your need as an armed man.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2024.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 24</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.12] - Reference, Psalm 62:12; Matthew 16:27; Romans 2:6; Ephesians 6:8.</p>
  <p>[v.23] - Reference, Deuteronomy 16:19.</p>
