  <p>1 [<span class="it">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p>2&emsp; What, my son? And what, the son of my womb?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And what, the son of my vows?</p>

    <p>3&emsp; Do not give your strength to women,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor for princes strong drink,</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Lest they drink, forget the law,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wine to those who are of heavy hearts.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Let him drink and forget his poverty<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and remember his misery no more.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Open your mouth for the mute<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the cause of all those who are appointed to destruction.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; Open your mouth, judge righteously,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the last part of the book of Proverbs, which some reckon the fifth, others the sixth. It contains the instructions of the mother of a prince, whose name was Lemuel, which she gave to him, and which are so valuable, as to be annexed to the proverbs of Solomon. The preface or introduction to the instructions (Proverbs 31:1); the address to her son, (Proverbs 31:2). The vices she cautions him against are uncleanness and intemperance, which she dissuades from because of the pernicious consequences of both to kings and to their subjects (Proverbs 31:3-5). She advises rather to give wine and strong drink to poor people, such as are in distress, as being more useful to them, at least less prejudicial (Proverbs 31:6-7); and exhorts her son to the duties of his office, by pleading the cause of the poor and injured, and administering justice to them (Proverbs 31:8-9). And then at large describes a virtuous woman, perhaps designed as an instruction to her son in the choice of a wife, (Proverbs 31:10-31); though more than that may be intended by it.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "virtuous woman" - Or, worthy woman, woman of valor.</p>
