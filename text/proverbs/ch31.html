  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2031.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 31</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the last part of the book of Proverbs, which some reckon the fifth, others the sixth. It contains the instructions of the mother of a prince, whose name was Lemuel, which she gave to him, and which are so valuable, as to be annexed to the proverbs of Solomon. The preface or introduction to the instructions (Proverbs 31:1); the address to her son, (Proverbs 31:2). The vices she cautions him against are uncleanness and intemperance, which she dissuades from because of the pernicious consequences of both to kings and to their subjects (Proverbs 31:3-5). She advises rather to give wine and strong drink to poor people, such as are in distress, as being more useful to them, at least less prejudicial (Proverbs 31:6-7); and exhorts her son to the duties of his office, by pleading the cause of the poor and injured, and administering justice to them (Proverbs 31:8-9). And then at large describes a virtuous woman, perhaps designed as an instruction to her son in the choice of a wife, (Proverbs 31:10-31); though more than that may be intended by it.</p>
  <p>[v.10] - "virtuous woman" - Or, worthy woman, woman of valor.</p>
