  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</p>

  <p>2 Also, for the soul to be without knowledge, it is not good. And he who hastes with his feet sins.</p>

  <p>3 The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart frets against the LORD.</p>

  <p>4 Wealth makes many friends, but the poor is separated from his neighbor.</p>

  <p>5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who speaks lies shall not escape.</p>

  <p>6 Many will entreat the favor of the prince. And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.</p>

  <p>7 All the brothers of the poor hate him. How much more do his friends go far from him? He pursues them with words, yet they are no more.</p>

  <p>8 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good.</p>

  <p>9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who speaks lies shall perish.</p>

  <p>10 Delight is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>

  <p>11 The discretion of a man defers his anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>

  <p>12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion, but his favor is as dew upon the grass.</p>

  <p>13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>

  <p>14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>

  <p>15 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>

  <p>16 He who keeps the commandment keeps his own soul, but he who despises his ways shall die.</p>

  <p>17 He who has pity upon the poor lends to the LORD, and that which he has given he will pay him back.</p>

  <p>18 Chasten your son while there is hope, and do not let your soul spare for his crying.</p>

  <p>19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment, for if you deliver him, yet you must do it again.</p>

  <p>20 Hear counsel and receive instruction, so that you may be wise in your latter end.</p>

  <p>21 There are many devices in a man's heart, but the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>

  <p>22 The desire of a man is his kindness. And a poor man is better than a liar.</p>

  <p>23 The fear of the LORD tends to life, and he who has it shall abide satisfied. He shall not be visited with evil.</p>

  <p>24 A slothful man hides his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>

  <p>25 Smite a scorner and the simple will take heed. And reprove one who has understanding and he will understand knowledge.</p>

  <p>26 He who wastes his father and chases away his mother, is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</p>

  <p>27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causes you to err from the words of knowledge.</p>

  <p>28 An ungodly witness scorns judgment, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</p>

  <p>29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</p>
