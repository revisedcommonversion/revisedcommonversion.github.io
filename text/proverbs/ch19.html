    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Better is the poor who walks in his integrity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Also, for the soul to be without knowledge, it is not good.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he who hastens with his feet sins.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The foolishness of man perverts his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his heart frets against the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Wealth makes many friends,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the poor is separated from his neighbor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who speaks lies shall not escape.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Many will entreat the favor of the prince.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> All the brothers of the poor hate him.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />How much more do his friends go far from him?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He pursues them with words, yet they are no more.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who keeps understanding shall find good.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who speaks lies shall perish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Delight is not appropriate for a fool,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The discretion of a man defers his anger,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his favor is as dew upon the grass.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> He who keeps the commandment keeps his own soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who despises his ways shall die.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He who has pity upon the poor lends to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and that which he has given he will pay him back.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Chasten your son while there is hope,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not let your soul spare for his crying.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for if you deliver him, yet you must do it again.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Hear counsel and receive instruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that you may be wise in your latter end.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> There are many devices in a man's heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The desire of a man is his kindness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And a poor man is better than a liar.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The fear of the LORD tends to life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who has it shall abide satisfied.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall not be visited with evil.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> A slothful man hides his hand in his bosom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Smite a scorner and the simple will take heed.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And reprove one who has understanding and he will understand knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He who wastes his father and chases away his mother<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that causes you to err from the words of knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> An ungodly witness scorns judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Judgments are prepared for scorners,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stripes for the back of fools.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2019.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 19</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
