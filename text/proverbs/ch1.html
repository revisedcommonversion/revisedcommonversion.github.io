  <p>1 [<span class="it">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> To know wisdom and instruction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to perceive the words of understanding,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> To receive the instruction of wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />justice, judgment, and equity,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> To give subtlety to the simple,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to the young man knowledge and discretion,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A wise man will hear and will increase learning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> To understand a proverb and the interpretation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the words of the wise and their dark sayings.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> My son, hear the instruction of your father<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not forsake the law of your mother,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> For they shall be an ornament of grace to your head<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and chains around your neck.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> My son, if sinners entice you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />do not consent.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> If they say, "Come with us. Let us lie in wait for blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and whole, as those who go down into the pit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> We shall find all precious substance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />We shall fill our houses with plunder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Cast in your lot among us.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let us all have one purse,"</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My son, do not walk in the way with them.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Refrain your foot from their path,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> For their feet run to evil<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and make haste to shed blood.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Surely in vain the net is spread<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the sight of any bird.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> And they lie in wait for their own blood.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They lurk secretly for their own lives.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Thus are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />who takes away the life of its owners.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Wisdom cries outside.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She utters her voice in the streets.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> She cries in the chief place of concourse,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the openings of the gates.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />In the city she utters her words, saying,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the scorners delight in their scorning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and fools hate knowledge?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Turn at my reproof.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will make my words known to you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Because I have called and you refused,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> But you have set at nothing all my counsel<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and rejected my reproof.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> I also will laugh at your calamity.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I will mock when your fear comes,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> When your fear comes as desolation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your destruction comes as a whirlwind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when distress and anguish come upon you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> They shall call upon me, but I will not answer.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> For they hated knowledge<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and did not choose the fear of the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> They rejected my counsel.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They despised all my reproof.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Therefore, they shall eat of the fruit of their own way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and be filled with their own devices.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> But whoever listens to me shall dwell in safety<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall be quiet from fear of evil."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2001.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 1</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>After the inscription, which gives the title of the book and describes the author by his name, descent, and dignity (Proverbs 1:1), follows the scope and design of it, which is to teach men wisdom and knowledge, even such as are simple and foolish, and particularly young men; nay, hereby wise men may grow wiser, and attain to a higher degree of learning (Proverbs 1:2-6); and the "first" doctrine taught in it is the fear of theLord, or devotion to God, which is the beginning of knowledge, though despised by fools (Proverbs 1:7). The next is obedience to parents, whose instructions, attended to, are more ornamental than chains of gold (Proverbs 1:8-9). And then follows a dissuasive from bad company, in which the arguments made use of by wicked men to draw in others with them, and the danger of compliance, are most strongly and beautifully represented (Proverbs 1:10-19). Then Wisdom, who is the instructor and teacher throughout the whole, is introduced as calling upon the simple and the scorners to leave their sins and turn to her, with a promise of the Spirit to them (Proverbs 1:20-23); but they slighting and rejecting her call, are threatened with just and irrevocable ruin and destruction (Proverbs 1:24-32). And the chapter is closed with a promise of safety and rest to those who hearken to her (Proverbs 1:33).</p>
