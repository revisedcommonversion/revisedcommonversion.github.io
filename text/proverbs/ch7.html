  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> My son, keep my words<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lay up my commandments with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> Keep my commandments and live,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my law as the apple of your eye.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Bind them upon your fingers.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Write them upon the tablet of your heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Say to wisdom, "You are my sister,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and call understanding your kinswoman,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> So that they may keep you from the strange woman,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />from the stranger who flatters with her words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> For at the window of my house<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I looked through my casement,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> And beheld among the simple ones.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I discerned among the youths<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />a young man void of understanding,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Passing through the street near her corner.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he went the way to her house,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> In the twilight, in the evening,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the black and dark night.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> And behold, a woman met him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> (She is loud and stubborn.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Her feet do not abide in her house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Now she is outside, now in the streets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lies in wait at every corner.)</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> So she caught him, kissed him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with an impudent face said to him,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> "I have peace-offerings with me.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />This day I have paid my vows.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> Therefore, I came forth to meet you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I have perfumed my bed<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Let us solace ourselves with affection.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> For the husband is not at home.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He has gone on a long journey.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> He has taken a bag of money with him<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and will come home at the day appointed."</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />With the flattering of her lips she impelled him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> He goes after her quickly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as an ox goes to the slaughter,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Until a dart strikes through his liver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />as a bird hastens to the snare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not know that it is for his life.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> Now therefore, listen to me, O children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Do not let your heart decline to her ways.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not go astray in her paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> For she has cast down many wounded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and many strong men have been slain by her.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> Her house is the way to hell,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />going down to the chambers of death.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>The sum of this chapter is to exhort men to attend to the doctrines and precepts of Wisdom in order to avoid the adulterous woman, the exhortation to keep them with care, affection, and delight, in order to answer the end (Proverbs 7:1-5). A story is told, from Solomon's own knowledge, of a young man ensnared and ruined by a lewd woman, it begins (Proverbs 7:6). The young man is described as foolish and as throwing himself in the way of temptation (Proverbs 7:7-9); the harlot who met him is described by her attire, her subtlety, her voice, her inconstancy, her impudence, and pretensions to piety (Proverbs 7:10-14). The arguments she made use of to prevail upon him to go with her are taken partly from the elegance of her bed, the softness of it, and its sweet perfume, and satiety of love to be enjoyed in it (Proverbs 7:15-18); and partly from the absence of her husband, who was gone a long journey, and had made provision for it for a certain time (Proverbs 7:19,20). By which arguments she prevailed upon him to his utter ruin, which is illustrated by the similes of an ox going to the slaughter, a fool to the stocks, and a bird to the snare (Proverbs 7:21-23). And the chapter is concluded with an exhortation to hearken to the words of Wisdom and to avoid the ways and paths of the harlot, by which many and mighty persons have been ruined, they being the direct road to hell and death (Proverbs 7:24-27).</p>
