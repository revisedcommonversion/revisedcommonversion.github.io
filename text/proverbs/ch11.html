  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is his delight.</p>

  <p>2 When pride comes, shame comes, but with the lowly is wisdom.</p>

  <p>3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</p>

  <p>4 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.</p>

  <p>5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>

  <p>6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but transgressors shall be taken in their own desires.</p>

  <p>7 When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of unjust men perishes.</p>

  <p>8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead.</p>

  <p>9 A hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth, but through knowledge the just shall be delivered.</p>

  <p>10 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</p>

  <p>11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>

  <p>12 He who is void of wisdom despises his neighbor, but a man of understanding holds his peace.</p>

  <p>13 A gossiper reveals secrets, but he who is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.</p>

  <p>14 Where no counsel is, the people fall, but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>

  <p>15 He who is surety for a stranger shall suffer for it, and he who hates suretyship is secure.</p>

  <p>16 A gracious woman retains honor, and strong men retain riches.</p>

  <p>17 The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</p>

  <p>18 The wicked works a deceitful work, but to him who sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.</p>

  <p>19 As righteousness tends to life, so he who pursues evil pursues it to his own death.</p>

  <p>20 Those who are of a perverse heart are abominations to the LORD, but those who are upright in their way are his delight.</p>

  <p>21 Though hand joins in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished, but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</p>

  <p>22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman who is without discretion.</p>

  <p>23 The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</p>

  <p>24 There is one who scatters, and yet increases, and there is one who withholds more than is proper, but it tends to poverty.</p>

  <p>25 The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he who waters shall be watered also himself.</p>

  <p>26 He who withholds corn, the people shall curse him, but blessing shall be upon the head of him who sells it.</p>

  <p>27 He who diligently seeks good procures favor, but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.</p>

  <p>28 He who trusts in his riches shall fall, but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</p>

  <p>29 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind, and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.</p>

  <p>30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise.</p>

  <p>31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed upon the earth, much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QW0p5losGlXUj6WHLHtmqVzh1NY4gUKRiE_97jqdWRs" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 11</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - Reference, Deuteronomy 25:13-14; Proverbs 20:23.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - Quoted in 1st Peter 4:18.</p>
