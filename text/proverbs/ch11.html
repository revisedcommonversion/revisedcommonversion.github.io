    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> A false balance is an abomination to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a just weight is his delight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> When pride comes, shame comes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but with the lowly is wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The integrity of the upright shall guide them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but righteousness delivers from death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but transgressors shall be taken in their own desires.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the hope of unjust men perishes.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The righteous is delivered out of trouble,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wicked comes in his stead.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> A hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but through knowledge the just shall be delivered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> He who is void of wisdom despises his neighbor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a man of understanding holds his peace.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> A gossiper reveals secrets,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Where no counsel is, the people fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> He who is surety for a stranger shall suffer for it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who hates suretyship is secure.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> A gracious woman retains honor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and strong men retain riches.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> The merciful man does good to his own soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The wicked works a deceitful work,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to him who sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> As righteousness tends to life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so he who pursues evil pursues it to his own death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Those who are of a perverse heart are abominations to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who are upright in their way are his delight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Though hand joins in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the offspring of the righteous shall be delivered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a fair woman who is without discretion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The desire of the righteous is only good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> There is one who scatters, and yet increases,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there is one who withholds more than is proper, but it tends to poverty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The liberal soul shall be made fat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who waters shall be watered also himself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He who withholds grain, the people shall curse him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but blessing shall be upon the head of him who sells it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He who diligently seeks good procures favor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who seeks mischief, it shall come to him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> He who trusts in his riches shall fall,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who wins souls is wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed upon the earth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2011.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 11</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.1] - Reference, Deuteronomy 25:13-14; Proverbs 20:23.</p>
  <p>[v.31] - Quoted in 1st Peter 4:18.</p>
