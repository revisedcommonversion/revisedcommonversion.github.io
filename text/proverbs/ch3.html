  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commandments,</p>

  <p>2 For length of days, long life, and peace, they shall add to you.</p>

  <p>3 Do not let mercy and truth forsake you. Bind them about your neck. Write them upon the tablet of your heart.</p>

  <p>4 Then you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>

  <p>5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</p>

  <p>6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will direct your paths.</p>

  <p>7 Do not be wise in your own eyes. Fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>

  <p>8 It shall be health to your body and marrow to your bones.</p>

  <p>9 Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first-fruits of all your increase,</p>

  <p>10 And your barns shall be filled with plenty and your presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>

  <p>11 My son, do not despise the chastening of the LORD, neither be weary of his correction,</p>

  <p>12 For whom the LORD loves he corrects, even as a father [corrects] the son in whom he delights.</p>

  <p>13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who gets understanding,</p>

  <p>14 For its merchandise is better than the merchandise of silver and its gain than fine gold.</p>

  <p>15 She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.</p>

  <p>16 Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand, riches and honor.</p>

  <p>17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace.</p>

  <p>18 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her. And happy is everyone who retains her.</p>

  <p>19 The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth. By understanding he has established the heavens.</p>

  <p>20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>

  <p>21 My son, do not let them depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion,</p>

  <p>22 And they shall be life to your soul and grace to your neck.</p>

  <p>23 Then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</p>

  <p>24 When you lie down, you shall not be afraid. You shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.</p>

  <p>25 Do not be afraid of sudden fear or of the desolation of the wicked when it comes,</p>

  <p>26 For the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being taken.</p>

  <p>27 Do not withhold good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p>

  <p>28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, and tomorrow I will give," when you have it by you.</p>

  <p>29 Do not devise evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.</p>

  <p>30 Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</p>

  <p>31 Do not envy the oppressor, and choose none of his ways,</p>

  <p>32 For the perverse is an abomination to the LORD, but his secret is with the righteous.</p>

  <p>33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the just.</p>

  <p>34 Surely he scorns the scorners, but he gives grace to the lowly.</p>

  <p>35 The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
