  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hates reproof is brutish.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; A good man obtains favor from the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he will condemn a man of wicked devices.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; A man shall not be established by wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but she who makes him ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; The thoughts of the righteous are right,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The wicked are overthrown and are no more,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the house of the righteous shall stand.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; A man shall be commended according to his wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; He who is despised and has a servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is better than he who honors himself and is destitute of bread.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;A righteous man regards the life of his beast,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;He who tills his land shall be satisfied with bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who follows vain persons is void of understanding.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;The wicked desires the net of evil men,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the root of the righteous yields fruit.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the just shall come out of trouble.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the recompense of a man's hands shall be rendered to him.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who listens to counsel is wise.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;A fool's wrath is presently known,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a prudent man covers shame.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;He who speaks truth shows forth righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a false witness, deceit.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;There is one who speaks like the piercing of a sword,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the tongue of the wise is health.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;The lip of truth shall be established forever,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but to the counselors of peace is joy.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;No evil shall happen to the just,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who deal truly are his delight.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;A prudent man conceals knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the heart of fools proclaims foolishness.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;The hand of the diligent shall bear rule,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the slothful shall be under tribute.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Heaviness in the heart of man depresses it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a good word makes it glad.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the way of the wicked seduces them.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;The slothful man does not roast that which he took in hunting,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the substance of a diligent man is precious.</p>

    <p>28&emsp;In the way of righteousness is life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and in its path there is no death.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2012.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 12</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
