  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you,</p>

  <p>2 And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite.</p>

  <p>3 Do not be desirous of his dainties, for they are deceitful food.</p>

  <p>4 Do not labor to be rich. Cease from your own wisdom.</p>

  <p>5 Will you set your eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make for themselves wings. They fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>

  <p>6 Do not eat the bread of him who has an evil eye, neither desire his dainties,</p>

  <p>7 For as he thinks in his heart, so he is. "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</p>

  <p>8 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose your sweet words.</p>

  <p>9 Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</p>

  <p>10 Do not remove the old landmark, and do not enter into the fields of the fatherless,</p>

  <p>11 For their redeemer is mighty. He will plead their cause with you.</p>

  <p>12 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.</p>

  <p>13 Do not withhold correction from the child, for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>

  <p>14 You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from hell.</p>

  <p>15 My son, if your heart is wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>

  <p>16 Indeed, my heart shall rejoice, when your lips speak right things.</p>

  <p>17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but be in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>

  <p>18 For surely there is an end, and your expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

  <p>19 Hear, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.</p>

  <p>20 Do not be among drunkards, among riotous eaters of flesh,</p>

  <p>21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>

  <p>22 Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.</p>

  <p>23 Buy the truth and do not sell it, even wisdom, instruction, and understanding.</p>

  <p>24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice. And he who begets a wise child shall have joy of him.</p>

  <p>25 Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she who bore you shall rejoice.</p>

  <p>26 My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.</p>

  <p>27 For a lewd woman is a deep ditch, and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>

  <p>28 She also lies in wait as for prey, and increases the transgressors among men.</p>

  <p>29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has babbling? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?</p>

  <p>30 Those who tarry long at the wine, and those who go to seek mixed wine.</p>

  <p>31 Do not look upon the wine when it is red, when it gives its color in the cup, when it moves itself aright.</p>

  <p>32 At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.</p>

  <p>33 Your eyes shall behold strange women, and your heart shall utter perverse things.</p>

  <p>34 And you shall be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, or as he who lies upon the top of a mast.</p>

  <p>35 "They have stricken me," you will say, "and I was not sick. They have beaten me, and I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."</p>
