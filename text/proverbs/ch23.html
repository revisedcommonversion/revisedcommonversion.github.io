    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> When you sit to eat with a ruler,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />consider diligently what is before you,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> And put a knife to your throat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if you are a man given to appetite.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> Do not be desirous of his dainties,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for they are deceitful food.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Do not labor to be rich.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Cease from your own wisdom.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Will you set your eyes upon that which is not?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />For riches certainly make for themselves wings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Do not eat the bread of him who has an evil eye,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither desire his dainties,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For as he thinks in his heart, so he is.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> You shall vomit up the morsel which you have eaten<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and lose your sweet words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Do not speak in the ears of a fool,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Do not remove the old landmark,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not enter into the fields of the fatherless,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For their redeemer is mighty.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He will plead their cause with you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> Apply your heart to instruction<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your ears to the words of knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Do not withhold correction from the child,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> You shall beat him with the rod<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and shall deliver his soul from hell.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> My son, if your heart is wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Indeed, my heart shall rejoice<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when your lips speak right things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Do not let your heart envy sinners,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but be in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> For surely there is an end,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your expectation shall not be cut off.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Hear, my son, and be wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and guide your heart in the way.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> Do not be among drunkards,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />among riotous eaters of flesh,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Listen to your father who begot you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not despise your mother when she is old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> Buy the truth and do not sell it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even wisdom, instruction, and understanding.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And he who begets a wise child shall have joy of him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Your father and your mother shall be glad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and she who bore you shall rejoice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> My son, give me your heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your eyes observe my ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> For a lewd woman is a deep ditch,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> She also lies in wait as for prey<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and increases the transgressors among men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has babbling? Who has wounds without cause?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Who has redness of eyes?</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> Those who stay long at the wine,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who go to seek mixed wine.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Do not look upon the wine when it is red,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when it gives its color in the cup,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when it moves itself aright.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> At the last it bites like a serpent<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and stings like an adder.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Your eyes shall behold strange women,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your heart shall utter perverse things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> And you shall be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or as he who lies upon the top of a mast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> "They have stricken me," you will say, "and I was not sick.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They have beaten me, and I did not feel it.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2023.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 23</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
