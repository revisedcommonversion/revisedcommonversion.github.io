    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> A soft answer turns away wrath,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but grievous words stir up anger.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> The tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the mouth of fools pours out foolishness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The eyes of the LORD are in every place,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />beholding the evil and the good.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> A wholesome tongue is a tree of life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but perverseness in it is a breach in the spirit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A fool despises his father's instruction,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who regards reproof is prudent.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> In the house of the righteous is much treasure,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> The lips of the wise diffuse knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the heart of the foolish does not do so.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he loves him who follows after righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Correction is grievous to him who forsakes the way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who hates reproof shall die.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> Hell and destruction are before the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />how much more the hearts of the children of men!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> A scorner does not love one who reproves him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither will he go to the wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> All the days of the afflicted are evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is of a merry heart has a continual feast.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Better is little with the fear of the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than great treasure and trouble with it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than a stalled ox and hatred with it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> A wrathful man stirs up strife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is slow to anger appeases strife.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the way of the righteous is made plain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> A wise son makes a glad father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a foolish man despises his mother.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> Folly is joy to him who is destitute of wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a man of understanding walks uprightly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Without counsel purposes are disappointed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the multitude of counselors they are established.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> A man has joy by the answer of his mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a word spoken in due season, how good it is!</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The way of life is above to the wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so that he may depart from hell beneath.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he will establish the border of the widow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> The thoughts of the wicked are abominations to the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the words of the pure are pleasant words.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He who is greedy of gain troubles his own house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hates gifts shall live.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> The LORD is far from the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a good report makes the bones fat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> The ear that hears the reproof of life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />abides among the wise.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> He who refuses instruction despises his own soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hears reproof gets understanding.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and before honor is humility.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2015.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 15</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
