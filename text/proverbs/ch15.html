  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 A soft answer turns away wrath, but grievous words stir up anger.</p>

  <p>2 The tongue of the wise uses knowledge aright, but the mouth of fools pours out foolishness.</p>

  <p>3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</p>

  <p>4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it is a breach in the spirit.</p>

  <p>5 A fool despises his father's instruction, but he who regards reproof is prudent.</p>

  <p>6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>

  <p>7 The lips of the wise diffuse knowledge, but the heart of the foolish does not do so.</p>

  <p>8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</p>

  <p>9 The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD, but he loves him who follows after righteousness.</p>

  <p>10 Correction is grievous to him who forsakes the way, and he who hates reproof shall die.</p>

  <p>11 Hell and destruction are before the LORD, how much more the hearts of the children of men!</p>

  <p>12 A scorner does not love one who reproves him, neither will he go to the wise.</p>

  <p>13 A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance, but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</p>

  <p>14 The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge, but the mouth of fools feeds on foolishness.</p>

  <p>15 All the days of the afflicted are evil, but he who is of a merry heart has a continual feast.</p>

  <p>16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD, than great treasure and trouble with it.</p>

  <p>17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred with it.</p>

  <p>18 A wrathful man stirs up strife, but he who is slow to anger appeases strife.</p>

  <p>19 The way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns, but the way of the righteous is made plain.</p>

  <p>20 A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish man despises his mother.</p>

  <p>21 Folly is joy to him who is destitute of wisdom, but a man of understanding walks uprightly.</p>

  <p>22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed, but in the multitude of counselors they are established.</p>

  <p>23 A man has joy by the answer of his mouth, and a word spoken in due season, how good it is!</p>

  <p>24 The way of life is above to the wise, so that he may depart from hell beneath.</p>

  <p>25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud, but he will establish the border of the widow.</p>

  <p>26 The thoughts of the wicked are abominations to the LORD, but the words of the pure are pleasant words.</p>

  <p>27 He who is greedy of gain troubles his own house, but he who hates gifts shall live.</p>

  <p>28 The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil things.</p>

  <p>29 The LORD is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.</p>

  <p>30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart, and a good report makes the bones fat.</p>

  <p>31 The ear that hears the reproof of life abides among the wise.</p>

  <p>32 He who refuses instruction despises his own soul, but he who hears reproof gets understanding.</p>

  <p>33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom, and before honor is humility.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2015.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 15</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
