  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeks and intermeddles with all wisdom.</p>

  <p>2 A fool has no delight in understanding, but only that his heart may reveal itself.</p>

  <p>3 When the wicked comes, then contempt also comes, and with ignominy comes reproach.</p>

  <p>4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the well-spring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</p>

  <p>5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>

  <p>6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calls for strokes.</p>

  <p>7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>

  <p>8 The words of a gossiper are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>

  <p>9 He also who is slothful in his work is brother to him who is a great waster.</p>

  <p>10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower. The righteous runs into it, and is safe.</p>

  <p>11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own conceit.</p>

  <p>12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honor is humility.</p>

  <p>13 He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him.</p>

  <p>14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but who can bear a wounded spirit?</p>

  <p>15 The heart of the prudent gets knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</p>

  <p>16 A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.</p>

  <p>17 He who is first in his own cause seems just, but his neighbor comes and searches him.</p>

  <p>18 The lot causes contentions to cease, and parts between the mighty.</p>

  <p>19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>

  <p>20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth. And with the increase of his lips he shall be filled.</p>

  <p>21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it shall eat its fruit.</p>

  <p>22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from the LORD.</p>

  <p>23 The poor uses entreaties, but the rich answers roughly.</p>

  <p>24 A man of many friends may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p>
