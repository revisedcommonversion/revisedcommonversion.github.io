  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; He who is often reproved and hardens his neck<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when the wicked bears rule, the people mourn.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; He who loves wisdom makes his father glad,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who keeps company with harlots spends his substance.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; The king by judgment establishes the land,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who receives gifts overthrows it.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; A man who flatters his neighbor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />spreads a net for his feet.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous sings and rejoices.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The righteous considers the cause of the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the wicked does not regard to know it.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Scornful men bring a city into a snare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but wise men turn away wrath.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; If a wise man contends with a foolish man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whether he rages or laughs, there is no rest.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;The blood-thirsty hate the upright,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the just seek his soul.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;A fool utters all his mind,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a wise man keeps it in until afterward.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;If a ruler listens to lies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />all his servants are wicked.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;The poor and the deceitful man meet together,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the LORD enlightens both their eyes.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;The king who faithfully judges the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />his throne shall be established forever.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;The rod and reproof give wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Correct your son and he shall give you rest.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall even give delight to your soul.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;Where there is no vision, the people perish,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who keeps the law is happy.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;A servant will not be corrected by words,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for though he understands, he will not answer.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;He who delicately brings up his servant from a child<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall have him at length become his son.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;An angry man stirs up strife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a furious man abounds in transgression.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;A man's pride shall bring him low,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He hears cursing and does not disclose it.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;The fear of man brings a snare,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;Many seek the ruler's favor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but every man's judgment comes from the LORD.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;An unjust man is an abomination to the just,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.</p>
