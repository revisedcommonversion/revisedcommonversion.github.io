  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 He who is often reproved and hardens his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>

  <p>2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice, but when the wicked bears rule, the people mourn.</p>

  <p>3 He who loves wisdom makes his father glad, but he who keeps company with harlots spends his substance.</p>

  <p>4 The king by judgment establishes the land, but he who receives gifts overthrows it.</p>

  <p>5 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.</p>

  <p>6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare, but the righteous sings and rejoices.</p>

  <p>7 The righteous considers the cause of the poor, but the wicked does not regard to know it.</p>

  <p>8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare, but wise men turn away wrath.</p>

  <p>9 If a wise man contends with a foolish man, whether he rages or laughs, there is no rest.</p>

  <p>10 The blood-thirsty hate the upright, but the just seek his soul.</p>

  <p>11 A fool utters all his mind, but a wise man keeps it in until afterward.</p>

  <p>12 If a ruler listens to lies, all his servants are wicked.</p>

  <p>13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together, the LORD enlightens both their eyes.</p>

  <p>14 The king who faithfully judges the poor, his throne shall be established forever.</p>

  <p>15 The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings his mother to shame.</p>

  <p>16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases, but the righteous shall see their fall.</p>

  <p>17 Correct your son and he shall give you rest. He shall even give delight to your soul.</p>

  <p>18 Where there is no vision, the people perish, but he who keeps the law is happy.</p>

  <p>19 A servant will not be corrected by words, for though he understands, he will not answer.</p>

  <p>20 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>

  <p>21 He who delicately brings up his servant from a child shall have him at length become his son.</p>

  <p>22 An angry man stirs up strife, and a furious man abounds in transgression.</p>

  <p>23 A man's pride shall bring him low, but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p>

  <p>24 Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul. He hears cursing and does not disclose it.</p>

  <p>25 The fear of man brings a snare, but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</p>

  <p>26 Many seek the ruler's favor, but every man's judgment comes from the LORD.</p>

  <p>27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just, and he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.</p>
