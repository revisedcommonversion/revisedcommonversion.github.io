  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Better is a dry morsel and quietness with it, than a house full of sacrifices with strife.</p>

  <p>2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son who causes shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brothers.</p>

  <p>3 The refining-pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but the LORD tries the hearts.</p>

  <p>4 A wicked doer gives heed to false lips, and a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>

  <p>5 He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker, and he who is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>

  <p>6 Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children is their fathers.</p>

  <p>7 Excellent speech is not suitable for a fool, much less are lying lips for a prince.</p>

  <p>8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him who has it. Wherever it turns, it prospers.</p>

  <p>9 He who covers a transgression seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates chief friends.</p>

  <p>10 A reproof enters more into a wise man, than one hundred stripes into a fool.</p>

  <p>11 An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore, a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>

  <p>12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>

  <p>13 Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>

  <p>14 The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water; therefore, withdraw from contention before it is meddled with.</p>

  <p>15 He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the just, even the both of them are abominations to the LORD.</p>

  <p>16 Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it?</p>

  <p>17 A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>

  <p>18 A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.</p>

  <p>19 He loves transgression who loves strife. And he who exalts his gate seeks destruction.</p>

  <p>20 He who has a perverse heart finds no good, and he who has a deceitful tongue falls into mischief.</p>

  <p>21 He who begets a fool does it to his sorrow. And the father of a fool has no joy.</p>

  <p>22 A merry heart does good like a medicine, but a broken spirit dries the bones.</p>

  <p>23 A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom, to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>

  <p>24 Wisdom is before him who has understanding, but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</p>

  <p>25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him.</p>

  <p>26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</p>

  <p>27 He who has knowledge spares his words, and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>

  <p>28 Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise, and he who shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.</p>
