  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 My son, attend to my wisdom and bow your ear to my understanding,</p>

  <p>2 So that you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.</p>

  <p>3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil,</p>

  <p>4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>

  <p>5 Her feet go down to death. Her steps take hold upon hell.</p>

  <p>6 Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, so that you cannot know them.</p>

  <p>7 Hear me now therefore, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>

  <p>8 Remove your way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,</p>

  <p>9 Lest you give your honor to others and your years to the cruel,</p>

  <p>10 Lest strangers be filled with your wealth and your labors be in the house of a stranger,</p>

  <p>11 And you mourn at the last when your flesh and your body are consumed,</p>

  <p>12 And say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof,</p>

  <p>13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!</p>

  <p>14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly."</p>

  <p>15 Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</p>

  <p>16 Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</p>

  <p>17 Let them be only your own, and not for strangers with you.</p>

  <p>18 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth.</p>

  <p>19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe. Let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and be ravished always with her love.</p>

  <p>20 And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>

  <p>21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.</p>

  <p>22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</p>

  <p>23 He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
