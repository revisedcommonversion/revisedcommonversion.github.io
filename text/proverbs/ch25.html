  <p>1 [<span class="it">These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</span>]</p>

  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> The heaven for height and the earth for depth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Take away the dross from the silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and there shall come forth a vessel for the refiner.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Take away the wicked from before the king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Do not put forth yourself in the presence of the king,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not stand in the place of great men,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />whom your eyes have seen.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> Do not go forth hastily to strive,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest you not know what to do in the end thereof<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when your neighbor has put you to shame.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Debate your cause with your neighbor himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not reveal a secret to another,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Lest he who hears it put you to shame,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and your infamy not turn away.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> A word fitly spoken<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> As an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Whoever boasts himself of a false gift<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like clouds and wind without rain.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> By long forbearing a prince is persuaded,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a soft tongue breaks the bone.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> Have you found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest you be filled with it and vomit it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> Withdraw your foot from your neighbor's house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />lest he be weary of you and thus hate you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> A man who bears false witness against his neighbor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is a maul, a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> As he who takes away a garment in cold weather,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and as vinegar upon soda,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> If your enemy hungers, give him bread to eat,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and if he thirsts, give him water to drink,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> For you shall heap coals of fire upon his head,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the LORD will reward you.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> The north wind drives away rain,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so does an angry countenance to a backbiting tongue.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> It is better to dwell in a corner of the house-top<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> As cold waters to a thirsty soul,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is good news from a far country.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> A righteous man falling down before the wicked<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is as a turbid fountain and a corrupt spring.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> It is not good to eat much honey.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And for men to search their own glory is not glory.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> He who has no rule over his own spirit<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like a city that is broken down and without walls.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2025.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 25</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.7] - Reference, Luke 14:8-10.</p>
  <p>[v.21-22] - Quoted in Romans 12:20.</p>
