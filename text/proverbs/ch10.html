  <p>1 [<span class="it">The proverbs of Solomon.</span>] A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</p>

  <p>2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.</p>

  <p>3 The LORD will not allow the soul of the righteous to famish, but he casts away the substance of the wicked.</p>

  <p>4 He becomes poor who deals with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.</p>

  <p>5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.</p>

  <p>6 Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>

  <p>7 The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall perish.</p>

  <p>8 The wise in heart will receive commandments, but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

  <p>9 He who walks uprightly walks surely, but he who perverts his ways shall be known.</p>

  <p>10 He who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

  <p>11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>

  <p>12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all sins.</p>

  <p>13 In the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.</p>

  <p>14 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</p>

  <p>15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city. The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>

  <p>16 The labor of the righteous tends to life, but the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>

  <p>17 He is in the way of life who keeps instruction, but he who refuses reproof errs.</p>

  <p>18 He who hides hatred has lying lips, and he who utters a slander is a fool.</p>

  <p>19 In the multitude of words there is no lack of sin, but he who restrains his lips is wise.</p>

  <p>20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver. The heart of the wicked is of little worth.</p>

  <p>21 The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of wisdom.</p>

  <p>22 The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.</p>

  <p>23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief, but a man of understanding has wisdom.</p>

  <p>24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>

  <p>25 As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more, but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>

  <p>26 As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.</p>

  <p>27 The fear of the LORD prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>

  <p>28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>

  <p>29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright, but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</p>

  <p>30 The righteous shall never be removed, but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>

  <p>31 The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom, but the perverse tongue shall be cut out.</p>

  <p>32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked speaks perverseness.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2010.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 10</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From this chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
