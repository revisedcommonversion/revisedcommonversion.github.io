  <p>1 [<span class="it">The proverbs of Solomon.</span>] A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</p>

  <p>2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.</p>

  <p>3 The LORD will not allow the soul of the righteous to famish, but he casts away the substance of the wicked.</p>

  <p>4 He becomes poor who deals with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.</p>

  <p>5 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.</p>

  <p>6 Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>

  <p>7 The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall perish.</p>

  <p>8 The wise in heart will receive commandments, but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

  <p>9 He who walks uprightly walks surely, but he who perverts his ways shall be known.</p>

  <p>10 He who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

  <p>11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>

  <p>12 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all sins.</p>

  <p>13 In the lips of him who has understanding wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.</p>

  <p>14 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</p>

  <p>15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city. The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>

  <p>16 The labor of the righteous tends to life, but the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>

  <p>17 He is in the way of life who keeps instruction, but he who refuses reproof errs.</p>

  <p>18 He who hides hatred has lying lips, and he who utters a slander is a fool.</p>

  <p>19 In the multitude of words there is no lack of sin, but he who restrains his lips is wise.</p>

  <p>20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver. The heart of the wicked is of little worth.</p>

  <p>21 The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of wisdom.</p>

  <p>22 The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.</p>

  <p>23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief, but a man of understanding has wisdom.</p>

  <p>24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>

  <p>25 As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more, but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>

  <p>26 As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.</p>

  <p>27 The fear of the LORD prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>

  <p>28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>

  <p>29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright, but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</p>

  <p>30 The righteous shall never be removed, but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>

  <p>31 The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom, but the perverse tongue shall be cut out.</p>

  <p>32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked speaks perverseness.</p>
