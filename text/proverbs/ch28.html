  <div class="poetry">
    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> The wicked flee when no man pursues,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> For the transgression of a land many are its princes,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> A poor man who oppresses the poor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who keep the law contend with them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> Evil men do not understand judgment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but those who seek the LORD understand all things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Better is the poor who walks in his uprightness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than the rich who is perverse in his ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> He who keeps the law is a wise son,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is a companion of riotous men shames his father.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> He who by usury and unjust gain increases his substance,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />he shall gather it for him who will pity the poor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> He who turns away his ear from hearing the law,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even his prayer shall be an abomination.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Whoever causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall fall himself into his own pit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the upright shall have good things in possession.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The rich man is wise in his own conceit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the poor man who has understanding searches him out.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> When righteous men rejoice, there is great glory,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> He who covers his sins shall not prosper,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Happy is the man who fears always,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> As a roaring lion and a hungry bear,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> The prince who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hates covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> A man who does violence to the blood of any person<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />shall flee to the pit. Let no man stay him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> He who walks uprightly shall be saved,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who follows after vain persons shall be filled with poverty.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> A faithful man shall abound with blessings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> To have respect of persons is not good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> He who hastens to be rich has an evil eye<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and does not consider that poverty shall come upon him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> He who rebukes a man afterward shall find more favor<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />than he who flatters with the tongue.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> He who robs his father or his mother, and says, "It is no transgression,"<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> He who gives to the poor shall lack nothing,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who hides his eyes shall have many curses.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
