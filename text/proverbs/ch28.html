  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The wicked flee when no man pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>

  <p>2 For the transgression of a land many are its princes, but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</p>

  <p>3 A poor man who oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.</p>

  <p>4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law contend with them.</p>

  <p>5 Evil men do not understand judgment, but those who seek the LORD understand all things.</p>

  <p>6 Better is the poor who walks in his uprightness, than the rich who is perverse in his ways.</p>

  <p>7 He who keeps the law is a wise son, but he who is a companion of riotous men shames his father.</p>

  <p>8 He who by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him who will pity the poor.</p>

  <p>9 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be an abomination.</p>

  <p>10 Whoever causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way shall fall himself into his own pit, but the upright shall have good things in possession.</p>

  <p>11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit, but the poor man who has understanding searches him out.</p>

  <p>12 When righteous men rejoice, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>

  <p>13 He who covers his sins shall not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.</p>

  <p>14 Happy is the man who fears always, but he who hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>

  <p>15 As a roaring lion and a hungry bear, so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>

  <p>16 The prince who lacks understanding is also a great oppressor, but he who hates covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>

  <p>17 A man who does violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit. Let no man stay him.</p>

  <p>18 He who walks uprightly shall be saved, but he who is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>

  <p>19 He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who follows after vain persons shall be filled with poverty.</p>

  <p>20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>

  <p>21 To have respect of persons is not good, because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.</p>

  <p>22 He who hastes to be rich has an evil eye and does not consider that poverty shall come upon him.</p>

  <p>23 He who rebukes a man afterward shall find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue.</p>

  <p>24 He who robs his father or his mother, and says, "It is no transgression," the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>

  <p>25 He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, but he who puts his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>

  <p>26 He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>

  <p>27 He who gives to the poor shall lack nothing, but he who hides his eyes shall have many curses.</p>

  <p>28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
