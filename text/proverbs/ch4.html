  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; Hear, children, the instruction of a father,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and attend to know understanding,</p>

    <p>2&emsp; For I give you good doctrine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not forsake my law.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; For I was my father's son,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; He taught me also, and said to me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />"Let your heart retain my words.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Keep my commandments, and live.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Get wisdom. Get understanding.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Do not forget it. Do not decline from the words of my mouth.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Do not forsake her, and she shall preserve you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Love her, and she shall keep you.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And with all your getting get understanding.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; Exalt her, and she shall promote you.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />She shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; She shall give to your head an ornament of grace.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />A crown of glory she shall deliver to you."</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the years of your life shall be many.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;I have taught you in the way of wisdom.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have led you in right paths.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;When you go, your steps shall not be hindered,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when you run, you shall not stumble.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;Take firm hold of instruction. Do not let her go.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Keep her, for she is your life.</p>

    <p>14&emsp;Do not enter into the path of the wicked,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not go in the way of evil men.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Avoid it, do not pass by it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />turn from it, and pass on.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;For they do not sleep, unless they have done mischief,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;For they eat the bread of wickedness<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and drink the wine of violence.</p>

    <p>18&emsp;But the path of the just is as the shining light<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that shines more and more to the perfect day.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;The way of the wicked is as darkness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />They do not know at what they stumble.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;My son, attend to my words.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Incline your ear to my sayings.</p>

    <p>21&emsp;Do not let them depart from your eyes.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Keep them in the midst of your heart.</p>

    <p>22&emsp;For they are life to those who find them<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and health to all their flesh.</p>

    <p>23&emsp;Keep your heart with all diligence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for out of it flows the source of life.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Put away from you a crooked mouth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and perverse lips put far from you.</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Let your eyes look right on,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let your eyelids look straight before you.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;Ponder the path of your feet,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and let all your ways be established.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;Do not turn to the right hand nor to the left.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Turn your foot away from evil.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter Solomon advises to seek after wisdom, to avoid bad company, and to continue in the right paths of goodness and truth. He excites attention to what he had to say, from the relation he stood in to the persons addressed, from the nature of his instructions, which were good and profitable, and from his own example in attending to those his parents gave him (Proverbs 4:1-4); he exhorts above all things to get wisdom, from the superior excellency of it and from the preservation, promotion, and honor to be had by it (Proverbs 4:5-9); and he further enforces big exhortations, from their being the means of a comfortable life and of the prolongation of it, and of leading in a right way without straitness or stumbling (Proverbs 4:10-13); and then proceeds to caution against bad company and going into a bad way of life, which is enforced from the mischief done by those who walk in it and from the darkness of it, to which the path of the just is opposed (Proverbs 4:14-19). And the exhortation to attend to and observe his instructions, and keep them, is repeated, from the consideration of their being life and health to them (Proverbs 4:20-22); and that they might be preserved and not departed from, directions are given about ordering the heart, mouth, lips, eyes, and feet (Proverbs 4:23-27).</p>
