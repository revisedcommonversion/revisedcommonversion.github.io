  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.</p>

  <p>2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirits.</p>

  <p>3 Commit your works to the LORD, and your thoughts shall be established.</p>

  <p>4 The LORD has made all things for himself, and even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>

  <p>5 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD. Though hand joins in hand, they shall not be unpunished.</p>

  <p>6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged, and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.</p>

  <p>7 When a man's ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>

  <p>8 Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues without right.</p>

  <p>9 A man's heart devises his way, but the LORD directs his steps.</p>

  <p>10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king. His mouth does not transgress in judgment.</p>

  <p>11 A just weight and balance are the LORD'S. All the weights of the bag are his work.</p>

  <p>12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness, for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>

  <p>13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings, and they love him who speaks right.</p>

  <p>14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death, but a wise man will pacify it.</p>

  <p>15 In the light of a king's countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>

  <p>16 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</p>

  <p>17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</p>

  <p>18 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>

  <p>19 Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>

  <p>20 He who handles a matter wisely shall find good. And whoever trusts in the LORD is happy.</p>

  <p>21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent. And the sweetness of the lips increases learning.</p>

  <p>22 Understanding is a well-spring of life to him who has it, but the instruction of fools is folly.</p>

  <p>23 The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, and adds learning to his lips.</p>

  <p>24 Pleasant words are as a honey-comb, sweet to the soul and health to the bones.</p>

  <p>25 There is a way that seems right to a man, but the ways of death are at its end.</p>

  <p>26 He who labors, labors for himself, for his mouth craves it of him.</p>

  <p>27 An ungodly man digs up evil, and in his lips there is as a burning fire.</p>

  <p>28 A perverse man sows strife, and a whisperer separates chief friends.</p>

  <p>29 A violent man entices his neighbor, and leads him into the way that is not good.</p>

  <p>30 He shuts his eyes to devise perverse things. Moving his lips he brings evil to pass.</p>

  <p>31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it is found in the way of righteousness.</p>

  <p>32 He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.</p>

  <p>33 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every verdict is from the LORD.</p>
