    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> She stands on the top of high places,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />by the way in the places of the paths.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />at the entrance of the doors,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> "To you, O men, I call,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> O you simple, understand wisdom,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and you fools, be of an understanding heart.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> Hear, for I will speak of excellent things,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> For my mouth shall speak truth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> They are all plain to him who understands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and right to those who find knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> Receive my instruction instead of silver,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> For wisdom is better than rubies,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> I, wisdom, dwell with prudence<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />Pride, arrogance, the evil way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the perverse mouth, I hate.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> Counsel and sound wisdom are mine.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I am understanding. I have strength.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> By me kings reign<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and princes decree justice.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> By me princes rule,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> I love those who love me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and those who seek me early shall find me.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> Riches and honor are with me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />durable riches and righteousness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and my revenue than choice silver.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> I lead in the way of righteousness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> So that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And I will fill their treasures.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before his works of old.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or before the earth was.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> When there were no depths, I was brought forth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> Before the mountains were settled,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />before the hills I was brought forth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> When he prepared the heavens, I was there.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> When he established the clouds above,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when he strengthened the fountains of the deep,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> When he gave to the sea his decree<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />that the waters should not pass his commandment,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when he appointed the foundations of the earth,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> I was by him, as one brought up with him,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and I was daily his delight,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />rejoicing always before him,</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />And my delights were with the sons of men.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> Now therefore, listen to me, O children,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Hear instruction and be wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and do not refuse it.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Blessed is the man who hears me,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />watching daily at my gates,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> For whoever finds me finds life<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and obtains favor from the LORD.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">36</span> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />All those who hate me love death."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the instructions of Wisdom or Christ, showing the excellency of them and the author of them in opposition to the harlot and her allurements in the preceding chapter. Christ, under the name of Wisdom, is represented as a herald, publishing the Gospel in the ministry of the word, either in person or by his servants (Proverbs 8:1). The places where this proclamation is made are described (Proverbs 8:2-3); the persons to whom the proclamation is made (Proverbs 8:4-5). The excellency of the things delivered, being right things, truth, agreeably to the word of God, plain and easy to be understood and of more worth than gold, silver, and precious stones (Proverbs 8:6-11). And then Wisdom, or Christ, is commended and recommended by his consummate prudence and knowledge, by his hatred of evil, and by his influence on the political affairs of kings and princes (Proverbs 8:12-16); and the advantages of those who are early seekers of him are pointed out, their enjoyment of his favor, of his riches, honor and righteousness, and their being led by him in right paths now, and inheriting eternal glory hereafter (Proverbs 8:17-21). And next follows an account of his existence from eternity as a divine Person, illustrated by a variety of phrases (Proverbs 8:22-29); and of his being with the Father, of his great affection for him and complacency in him, and of Christ's wonderful delight and pleasure in the sons of men (Proverbs 8:30-31). And the chapter is concluded with an exhortation to them to hearken to his instructions, setting forth the happiness of those who wait on him in public ordinances and find him, and the misery of those who hate and reject him.</p>
