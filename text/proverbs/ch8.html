  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Does wisdom not cry, and understanding put forth her voice?</p>

  <p>2 She stands on the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>

  <p>3 She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance of the doors,</p>

  <p>4 "To you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>

  <p>5 O you simple, understand wisdom, and you fools, be of an understanding heart.</p>

  <p>6 Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>

  <p>7 For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>

  <p>8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</p>

  <p>9 They are all plain to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.</p>

  <p>10 Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>

  <p>11 For wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>

  <p>12 I, wisdom, dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions.</p>

  <p>13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. Pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth, I hate.</p>

  <p>14 Counsel and sound wisdom are mine. I am understanding. I have strength.</p>

  <p>15 By me kings reign and princes decree justice.</p>

  <p>16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>

  <p>17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.</p>

  <p>18 Riches and honor are with me, durable riches and righteousness.</p>

  <p>19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.</p>

  <p>20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>

  <p>21 So that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance. And I will fill their treasures.</p>

  <p>22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>

  <p>23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or before the earth was.</p>

  <p>24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>

  <p>25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills I was brought forth,</p>

  <p>26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>

  <p>27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,</p>

  <p>28 When he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep,</p>

  <p>29 When he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, and when he appointed the foundations of the earth,</p>

  <p>30 I was by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him,</p>

  <p>31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth. And my delights were with the sons of men.</p>

  <p>32 Now therefore, listen to me, O children, for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>

  <p>33 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not refuse it.</p>

  <p>34 Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>

  <p>35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD.</p>

  <p>36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death."</p>
