  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Does wisdom not cry, and understanding put forth her voice?</p>

  <p>2 She stands on the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>

  <p>3 She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entrance of the doors,</p>

  <p>4 "To you, O men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>

  <p>5 O you simple, understand wisdom, and you fools, be of an understanding heart.</p>

  <p>6 Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>

  <p>7 For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>

  <p>8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</p>

  <p>9 They are all plain to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.</p>

  <p>10 Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>

  <p>11 For wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>

  <p>12 I, wisdom, dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of ingenious inventions.</p>

  <p>13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. Pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth, I hate.</p>

  <p>14 Counsel and sound wisdom are mine. I am understanding. I have strength.</p>

  <p>15 By me kings reign and princes decree justice.</p>

  <p>16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>

  <p>17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.</p>

  <p>18 Riches and honor are with me, durable riches and righteousness.</p>

  <p>19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.</p>

  <p>20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>

  <p>21 So that I may cause those who love me to inherit substance. And I will fill their treasures.</p>

  <p>22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>

  <p>23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or before the earth was.</p>

  <p>24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>

  <p>25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills I was brought forth,</p>

  <p>26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>

  <p>27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,</p>

  <p>28 When he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep,</p>

  <p>29 When he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, and when he appointed the foundations of the earth,</p>

  <p>30 I was by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him,</p>

  <p>31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth. And my delights were with the sons of men.</p>

  <p>32 Now therefore, listen to me, O children, for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>

  <p>33 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not refuse it.</p>

  <p>34 Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>

  <p>35 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD.</p>

  <p>36 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death."</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wJgIROyi0UWliVcsZ0QeLcnVnF54U47wCN74ue6Af6M" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 8</a></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>This chapter contains the instructions of Wisdom or Christ, showing the excellency of them and the author of them in opposition to the harlot and her allurements in the preceding chapter. Christ, under the name of Wisdom, is represented as a herald, publishing the Gospel in the ministry of the word, either in person or by his servants (Proverbs 8:1). The places where this proclamation is made are described (Proverbs 8:2-3); the persons to whom the proclamation is made (Proverbs 8:4-5). The excellency of the things delivered, being right things, truth, agreeably to the word of God, plain and easy to be understood and of more worth than gold, silver, and precious stones (Proverbs 8:6-11). And then Wisdom, or Christ, is commended and recommended by his consummate prudence and knowledge, by his hatred of evil, and by his influence on the political affairs of kings and princes (Proverbs 8:12-16); and the advantages of those who are early seekers of him are pointed out, their enjoyment of his favor, of his riches, honor and righteousness, and their being led by him in right paths now, and inheriting eternal glory hereafter (Proverbs 8:17-21). And next follows an account of his existence from eternity as a divine Person, illustrated by a variety of phrases (Proverbs 8:22-29); and of his being with the Father, of his great affection for him and complacency in him, and of Christ's wonderful delight and pleasure in the sons of men (Proverbs 8:30-31). And the chapter is concluded with an exhortation to them to hearken to his instructions, setting forth the happiness of those who wait on him in public ordinances and find him, and the misery of those who hate and reject him.</p>
