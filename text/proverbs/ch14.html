    <p><span class="vsnumsp">1&nbsp;</span> Every wise woman builds her house,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the foolish plucks it down with her hands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">2&nbsp;</span> He who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is perverse in his ways despises him.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">3&nbsp;</span> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">4&nbsp;</span> Where no oxen are, the manger is clean,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but much increase is by the strength of the ox.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">5&nbsp;</span> A faithful witness will not lie,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a false witness will utter lies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">6&nbsp;</span> A scorner seeks wisdom and does not find it,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but knowledge is easy to him who understands.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">7&nbsp;</span> Go from the presence of a foolish man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />when you do not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">8&nbsp;</span> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the folly of fools is deceit.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">9&nbsp;</span> Fools make a mock at sin,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but among the righteous there is favor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">10</span> The heart knows its own bitterness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a stranger does not intermeddle with its joy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">11</span> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">12</span> There is a way which seems right to a man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the ways of death are at its end.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">13</span> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the end of that mirth is heaviness.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">14</span> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">15</span> The simple believes every word,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the prudent man looks well to his going.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">16</span> A wise man fears and departs from evil,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the fool rages and is confident.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">17</span> He who is quick to anger deals foolishly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">18</span> The simple inherit folly,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">19</span> The evil bow before the good,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">20</span> The poor is hated even by his own neighbor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the rich has many friends.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">21</span> He who despises his neighbor sins,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who has mercy on the poor is happy.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">22</span> Do those who devise evil not err?<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />But mercy and truth shall be to those who devise good.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">23</span> In all labor there is profit,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the talk of the lips tends only to penury.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">24</span> The crown of the wise is their riches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the foolishness of fools is folly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">25</span> A true witness delivers souls,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but a deceitful witness speaks lies.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">26</span> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and his children shall have a place of refuge.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">27</span> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />to depart from the snares of death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">28</span> In the multitude of people is the king's honor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">29</span> He who is slow to wrath is of great understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who is hasty of spirit exalts folly.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">30</span> A sound heart is the life of the flesh,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but envy the rottenness of the bones.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">31</span> He who oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but he who honors him has mercy on the poor.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">32</span> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the righteous has hope in his death.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">33</span> Wisdom rests in the heart of him who has understanding,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and it is made known in the midst of fools.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">34</span> Righteousness exalts a nation,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but sin is a reproach to any people.</p>

    <p><span class="vsnumsp">35</span> The king's favor is toward a wise servant,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but his wrath is against him who causes shame.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2014.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 14</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
