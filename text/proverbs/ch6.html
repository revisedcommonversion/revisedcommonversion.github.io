  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,</p>

  <p>2 You are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth.</p>

  <p>3 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself when you have come into the hand of your friend: go, humble yourself, and make urgent request to your friend.</p>

  <p>4 Do not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</p>

  <p>5 Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>

  <p>6 Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways and be wise.</p>

  <p>7 She, having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>

  <p>8 Provides her provisions in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.</p>

  <p>9 How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?</p>

  <p>10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep,</p>

  <p>11 And your poverty shall come as one who travels, and your lack as an armed man.</p>

  <p>12 A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a crooked mouth.</p>

  <p>13 He winks with his eyes. He speaks with his feet. He teaches with his fingers.</p>

  <p>14 Perverseness is in his heart. He devises mischief continually. He sows discord.</p>

  <p>15 Therefore, his calamity shall come suddenly. He shall be suddenly broken without remedy.</p>

  <p>16 These six things the LORD hates, even seven are abominations to him:</p>

  <p>17 A proud look, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>

  <p>18 A heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</p>

  <p>19 A false witness who speaks lies, and him who sows discord among brothers.</p>

  <p>20 My son, keep your father's commandment and do not forsake the law of your mother.</p>

  <p>21 Bind them continually upon your heart and tie them around your neck.</p>

  <p>22 When you go, it shall lead you. When you sleep, it shall keep you. And when you awake, it shall talk with you.</p>

  <p>23 For the commandment is a lamp, the law is light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</p>

  <p>24 To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>

  <p>25 Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her take you with her eyelids.</p>

  <p>26 For by means of a lewd woman a man is brought to a piece of bread, and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>

  <p>27 Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?</p>

  <p>28 Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned?</p>

  <p>29 Such is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife. Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.</p>

  <p>30 Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.</p>

  <p>31 But if he is found, he shall restore seven-fold. He shall give all the substance of his house.</p>

  <p>32 But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.</p>

  <p>33 He shall get a wound and dishonor, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>

  <p>34 For jealousy is the rage of a man; therefore, he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>

  <p>35 He will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</p>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter the wise man dissuades from rash suretyship, exposes the sin of idleness, describes a wicked man, makes mention of seven things hated by God, exhorts to attend to parental instructions and precepts, and cautions against adultery. Suretyship is described (Proverbs 6:1); and represented as a snare and a net in which men are taken (Proverbs 6:2); and advice is given what to do in such a case, for safety in it, and deliverance from it (Proverbs 6:3-5); The sin of slothfulness is exposed by observing the industry of the ant (Proverbs 6:6-8); by expostulating with the sluggard for his continuance in sloth and by mimicking him (Proverbs 6:9-10); and by the poverty it brings upon him (Proverbs 6:11). Then a naughty wicked man is described by his mouth, eyes, feet, fingers, and heart, whose ruin is sudden and inevitable (Proverbs 6:11-15). The seven things hated by God are particularly named (Proverbs 6:16-19). And next the exhortation in some preceding chapters is reassumed to attend to the instructions of parents, which will be found ornamental, pleasant, and useful (Proverbs 6:20-23). Especially to preserve from the lewd woman cautioned against (Proverbs 6:24-25); whose company is dissuaded from, on account of the extreme poverty and distress she brings persons to, and even danger of life (Proverbs 6:26); from the unavoidable ruin such come into (Proverbs 6:27-29); from the sin of uncleanness being greater than that of theft (Proverbs 6:30-31); from the folly the adulterer betrays, from the destruction of his soul and the disgrace he brings on himself (Proverbs 6:32-33); and from the rage and irreconcilable offence of the husband of the adulteress (Proverbs 6:34-35).</p>
