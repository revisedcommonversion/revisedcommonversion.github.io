  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 Wisdom has built her house. She has hewn out her seven pillars.</p>

  <p>2 She has killed her beasts. She has mingled her wine. She has also furnished her table.</p>

  <p>3 She has sent forth her attendants. She cries upon the highest places of the city,</p>

  <p>4 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here." As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,</p>

  <p>5 "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>

  <p>6 Forsake the foolish and live. And go in the way of understanding."</p>

  <p>7 He who reproves a scorner gets shame for himself. And he who rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot.</p>

  <p>8 Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.</p>

  <p>9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser. Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</p>

  <p>10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>

  <p>11 For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.</p>

  <p>12 If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.</p>

  <p>13 A foolish woman is clamorous. She is simple and knows nothing.</p>

  <p>14 For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>

  <p>15 To call to passengers who go right on their ways,</p>

  <p>16 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here." And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,</p>

  <p>17 "Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."</p>

  <p>18 But he does not know that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>In this chapter, Wisdom, or Christ, is represented as having built a stately house or palace for the entertainment of his guests (Proverbs 9:1); as having made large and suitable provisions for them (Proverbs 9:2); and as having sent his servants to invite them to come and partake of them and quit all other company but his (Proverbs 9:3-6); when it is observed who are and who are not to be reproved, with the reasons of it (Proverbs 9:7-9); and what is the sum and substance of true wisdom, and what the advantages of it both here and hereafter (Proverbs 9:10-12). And the chapter is concluded with the description of the foolish woman, the opposite of Wisdom, who is represented as clamorous, simple, and ignorant (Proverbs 9:13); and calling to passengers that go by her door and inviting them in to partake of her provisions (Proverbs 9:14-17); the consequence of which is sure and certain death and destruction to her guests (Proverbs 9:18).</p>
