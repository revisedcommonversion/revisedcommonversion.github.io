  <!--chapter text-->

  <p>1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and loving favor rather than silver and gold.</p>

  <p>2 The rich and poor meet together. The LORD is the maker of them all.</p>

  <p>3 A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.</p>

  <p>4 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, honor, and life.</p>

  <p>5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse. He who keeps his soul shall be far from them.</p>

  <p>6 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>

  <p>7 The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.</p>

  <p>8 He who sows iniquity shall reap vanity, and the rod of his anger shall fail.</p>

  <p>9 He who has a bountiful eye shall be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the poor.</p>

  <p>10 Cast out the scorner and contention shall end, even strife and reproach shall cease.</p>

  <p>11 He who loves pureness of heart for the grace of his lips, the king shall be his friend.</p>

  <p>12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthrows the words of the transgressor.</p>

  <p>13 The slothful man says, "There is a lion outside. I shall be slain in the streets."</p>

  <p>14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit. He who is abhorred by the LORD shall fall therein.</p>

  <p>15 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>

  <p>16 He who oppresses the poor to increase his riches, and he who gives to the rich, shall surely come to poverty.</p>

  <p>17 Bow down your ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge,</p>

  <p>18 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you, if they are ready in your lips.</p>

  <p>19 So that your trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to you this day, even to you.</p>

  <p>20 Have I not written to you excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</p>

  <p>21 So that I might make you know the certainty of the words of truth, and so that you might answer the words of truth to those who send to you?</p>

  <p>22 Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the gate,</p>

  <p>23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those who spoiled them.</p>

  <p>24 Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man you shall not go,</p>

  <p>25 Lest you learn his ways, and get a snare to your soul.</p>

  <p>26 Do not be one of those who strike hands, or of those who are sureties for debts.</p>

  <p>27 If you have nothing to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?</p>

  <p>28 Do not remove the ancient landmark, which your fathers have set.</p>

  <p>29 Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings. He shall not stand before obscure men.</p>
