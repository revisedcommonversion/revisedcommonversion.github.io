  <div class="poetry">
    <p>1&emsp; A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and loving favor rather than silver and gold.</p>

    <p>2&emsp; The rich and poor meet together.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />The LORD is the maker of them all.</p>

    <p>3&emsp; A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the simple pass on and are punished.</p>

    <p>4&emsp; By humility and the fear of the LORD<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />are riches, honor, and life.</p>

    <p>5&emsp; Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who keeps his soul shall be far from them.</p>

    <p>6&emsp; Train up a child in the way he should go,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>

    <p>7&emsp; The rich rules over the poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the borrower is servant to the lender.</p>

    <p>8&emsp; He who sows iniquity shall reap vanity,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and the rod of his anger shall fail.</p>

    <p>9&emsp; He who has a bountiful eye shall be blessed,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for he gives of his bread to the poor.</p>

    <p>10&emsp;Cast out the scorner and contention shall end,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />even strife and reproach shall cease.</p>

    <p>11&emsp;He who loves pureness of heart<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />for the grace of his lips, the king shall be his friend.</p>

    <p>12&emsp;The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he overthrows the words of the transgressor.</p>

    <p>13&emsp;The slothful man says, "There is a lion outside.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I shall be slain in the streets."</p>

    <p>14&emsp;The mouth of strange women is a deep pit.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He who is abhorred by the LORD shall fall therein.</p>

    <p>15&emsp;Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>

    <p>16&emsp;He who oppresses the poor to increase his riches,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and he who gives to the rich, shall surely come to poverty.</p>

    <p>17&emsp;Bow down your ear and hear the words of the wise,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and apply your heart to my knowledge,</p>

    <p>18&emsp;For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />if they are ready in your lips.</p>

    <p>19&emsp;So that your trust may be in the LORD,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />I have made known to you this day, even to you.</p>

    <p>20&emsp;Have I not written to you excellent things<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />in counsels and knowledge,</p>

    <p>21&emsp;So that I might make you know the certainty of the words of truth,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and so that you might answer the words of truth to those who send to you?</p>

    <p>22&emsp;Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />neither oppress the afflicted in the gate,</p>

    <p>23&emsp;For the LORD will plead their cause<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and plunder the soul of those who plundered them.</p>

    <p>24&emsp;Make no friendship with an angry man,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and with a furious man you shall not go,</p>

    <p>25&emsp;Lest you learn his ways<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />and get a snare to your soul.</p>

    <p>26&emsp;Do not be one of those who strike hands,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />or of those who are sureties for debts.</p>

    <p>27&emsp;If you have nothing to pay,<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />why should he take away your bed from under you?</p>

    <p>28&emsp;Do not remove the ancient landmark<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />which your fathers have set.</p>

    <p>29&emsp;Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings.<span class="linebr">/</span> <br />He shall not stand before obscure men.</p>

  <h4>Commentary</h4>
  <p><a href="https://codeberg.org/revisedcommonversion/matthew-henry-commentary/src/branch/main/proverbs/MHC%20-%20Proverbs%2C%20Chapter%2022.md" target="_blank">Matthew Henry Commentary - Proverbs, Chapter 22</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup></p>
  
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p class="bold">John Gill's Chapter Summary:</p>
  <p>From the tenth chapter to the twenty-fifth are various proverbial sentences without any very apparent connection or coherence with each other, describing righteous and wicked men, setting forth their different temper, conduct, and actions, and the fruits and effects of them. It should be observed, that frequently in the preceding chapters two persons are represented as women: one goes by the name of "Wisdom," the other is called the "foolish" woman and a "harlot," the former is clearly to be understood of Christ, and the latter, being opposed to him, must be antichrist, the whore of Rome and mother of harlots. Now in the following part of this book two sorts of persons are spoken of, the one as wise, righteous, good, etc., and the other as foolish, wicked, etc., who are no other than the followers of Christ and antichrist, which observation is a key to the whole book.</p>
  <p>[v.8] - Quoted in 2nd Corinthians 9:7. This verse reads a little differently in the Septuagint with some extra text added. It reads as follows in English: "He who sows wickedness shall reap troubles; and shall fully receive the punishment of his deeds. God loves a cheerful and liberal man; but [a man] shall fully prove the folly of his works." Take note of the phrase, "God loves a cheerful and liberal man," as this is the phrase quoted in 2nd Corinthians 9:7. Here is a comparison of the Greek: "<span class="gr-heb">ἄνδρα ἱλαρὸν καὶ δότην εὐλογεῖ ὁ θεός</span>" (LXX); "<span class="gr-heb">ἱλαρὸν γὰρ δότην ἀγαπᾷ ὁ θεός</span>" (NT). Paul paraphrases the passage a bit by saying "a cheerful giver," rather than "a cheerful and liberal man." You could say that "a liberal man" and "a giver" can be synonymous.</p>
