  <h3>U - Z</h3>
  <h4>U</h4>
  <p><span class="bold">Urim</span> - The Urim and Thummim, among the Israelites, signify lights and perfections. These were a kind of ornament belonging to the habit of the high priest, in virtue of which he gave oracular answers to the people; but what they were has not been satisfactorily ascertained.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Usury</span> - 1) Formerly, interest; or a premium paid or stipulated to be paid for the use of money. 2) In present usage, illegal interest; a premium or compensation paid or stipulated to be paid for the use of money borrowed or retained, beyond the rate of interest established by law. 3) The practice of taking interest.</p>
  <h4>V</h4>
  <p><span class="bold">Variance</span> - Difference that produces dispute or controversy; disagreement; dissension; discord.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Vermilion</span> - 1) Red sulphuret of mercury; a bright, beautiful red color of two sorts, natural and artificial. The natural is found in silver mines, in the form of a ruddy sand, which is to be prepared by purification or washing, and then levigated with water on a stone. The factitious or common vermilion is made of artificial cinnabar, ground with white wine, and afterward with the white of an egg. 2) Any beautiful red color.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Vesture</span> - 1) A garment; a robe. 2) Clothing; covering.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Victuals</span> - Food for human beings, prepared for eating; that which supports human life; provisions; meat; sustenance. We never apply this word to that on which beasts or birds feed, and we apply it chiefly to food for men when cooked or prepared for the table. We do not now give this name to flesh, corn or flour, in a crude state; but we say, the victuals are well cooked or dressed, and in great abundance. We say, a man eats his victuals with a good relish.</p>
  <h4>W</h4>
  <p><span class="bold">Warp</span> - In manufactures, the threads, which are extended lengthwise in the loom, and crossed by the woof.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Wen</span> - An encysted swelling or tumor; also, a fleshy excrescence growing on animals, sometimes to a large size.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Woof</span> - The threads that cross the warp in weaving; the weft.</p>
  <h4>X</h4>
  <p>No words beginning with X.</p>
  <h4>Y</h4>
  <p><span class="bold">Yoke</span> - 1) A piece of timber, hollowed or made curving near each end, and fitted with bows for receiving the necks of oxen; by which means two are connected for drawing. From a ring or hook in the bow, a chain extends to the thing to be drawn, or to the yoke of another pair of oxen behind. 2) A mark of servitude; slavery; bondage. 3) A chain; a link; a bond of connection; as the yoke of marriage. 4) A couple; a pair; as a yoke of oxen. 5) Service. Matthew 11.</p>
  <h4>Z</h4>
  <p><span class="bold">Zeal</span> - Passionate ardor in the pursuit of anything. In general, zeal is an eagerness of desire to accomplish or obtain some object, and it may be manifested either in favor of any person or thing, or in opposition to it, and in a good or bad cause.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Zealous</span> - Warmly engaged or ardent in the pursuit of an object.</p>
