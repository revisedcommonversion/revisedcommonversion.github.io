  <h3>F</h3>
  <p><span class="bold">Faith</span> - Evangelical, justifying, or saving faith, is the assent of the mind to the truth of divine revelation, on the authority of God's testimony, accompanied with a cordial assent of the will or approbation of the heart; an entire confidence or trust in God's character and declarations, and in the character and doctrines of Christ, with an unreserved surrender of the will to his guidance, and dependence on his merits for salvation. In other words, that firm belief of God's testimony, and of the truth of the gospel, which influences the will, and leads to an entire reliance on Christ for salvation.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Fathom</span> - A measure of length containing six feet, the space to which a man may extend his arms; used chiefly at sea for measuring cables, cordage, and the depth of the sea is sounding by a line and lead.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Feign</span> - To make a show of; to pretend; to assume a false appearance; to counterfeit.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Firmament</span> - The region of the air; the sky or heavens. In scripture, the word denotes an expanse, a wide extent; for such is the signification of the Hebrew word, coinciding with regio, region, and reach. The original therefore does not convey the sense of solidity, but of stretching, extension; the great arch or expanse over our heads, in which are placed the atmosphere and the clouds, and in which the stars appear to be placed, and are really seen.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Flagon</span> - A vessel with a narrow mouth, used for holding and conveying liquors. It is generally larger than a bottle, and of leather or stoneware rather than of glass.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Fold</span> - 1) A pen or enclosure for sheep; a place where a flock of sheep is kept, whether in the field or under shelter. 2) A flock of sheep. Hence in a scriptural sense, the Church, the flock of the Shepherd of Israel. I have other sheep which are not of this fold (John 10:16).</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Founder</span> - One who founds; one who casts metals in various forms; a caster; as, a founder of cannon, bells, hardware, or types.</p>
  <p><span class="bold">Fret</span> - 1) To rub; to wear away a substance by friction; as, to fret cloth; to fret a piece of gold or other metal. 2) To corrode; to gnaw; to ear away; as, a worm frets the planks of a ship. 3) To tease; to irritate; to vex; to make angry.</p>
