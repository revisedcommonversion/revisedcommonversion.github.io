  <h3>Q - R</h3>
  <h4>Q</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Quadrans</dt>
    <dd>A Roman bronze coin of very small value. During the times of the writing of the New Testament, it was valued at a quarter of an assarion, or 1/40 of a denarius.</dd>
    <dt>Quaternion</dt>
    <dd>A file of four soldiers.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h4>R</h4>
  <dl>
    <dt>Rail</dt>
    <dd>To use insolent and reproachful language; to utter reproaches; to scoff.</dd>
    <dt>Ransom</dt>
    <dd>1) In Scripture, the price paid for a forfeited life, or for delivery or release from capital punishment.</dd>
    <dd>2) The price paid for procuring the pardon of sins and the redemption of the sinner from punishment.</dd>
    <dt>Rear-ward</dt>
    <dd>Definition of ward: The act of guarding; watch; guard; guardianship; specifically, a guarding during the day. One who, or that which, guards; garrison; defender; protector; means of guarding; defense; protection. The state of being under guard or guardianship; confinement under guard; the condition of a child under a guardian; custody.</dd>
    <dt>Redemption</dt>
    <dd>In theology, the purchase of God's favor by the death and sufferings of Christ; the ransom or deliverance of sinners from the bondage of sin and the penalties of God's violated law by the atonement of Christ.</dd>
    <dt>Religion</dt>
    <dd>1) Religion, in its most comprehensive sense, includes a belief in the being and perfections of God, in the revelation of his will to man, in man's obligation to obey his commands, in a state of reward and punishment, and in man's accountableness to God; and also true godliness or piety of life, with the practice of all moral duties. It therefore comprehends theology, as a system of doctrines or principles, as well as practical piety; for the practice of moral duties without a belief in a divine lawgiver, and without reference to his will or commands, is not religion.</dd>
    <dd>2) Religion, as distinct from theology, is godliness or real piety in practice, consisting in the performance of all known duties to God and our fellow men, in obedience to divine command, or from love to God and his law. James 1.</dd>
    <dd>3) Religion, as distinct from virtue, or morality, consists in the performance of the duties we owe directly to God, from a principle of obedience to his will. Hence we often speak of religion and virtue, as different branches of one system, or the duties of the first and second tables of the law.</dd>
    <dt>Remission</dt>
    <dd>Forgiveness; pardon; that is, the giving up of the punishment due to a crime; as the remission of sins. Matthew 26, Hebrews 9.</dd>
    <dt>Repent</dt>
    <dd>1) To feel pain, sorrow or regret for something done or spoken;</dd>
    <dd>2) To change the mind in consequence of the inconvenience or injury done by past conduct;</dd>
    <dd>3) In theology, to sorrow or be pained for sin, as a violation of God's holy law, a dishonor to his character and government, and the foulest ingratitude to a Being of infinite benevolence;</dd>
    <dd>4) This fourth definition comes from John Calvin's Commentary on Amos 7:3: "Now as to the word repent, as applied to God, let us know... that God does not change his purpose so as to retract what he has once determined... but he accommodates himself to the measure of men's understanding, when he mentions such changes."</dd>
    <dt>Repentance</dt>
    <dd>1) Real penitence; sorrow or deep contrition for sin, as an offense and dishonor to God, a violation of his holy law, and the basest ingratitude toward a Being of infinite benevolence. This is called evangelical repentance and is accompanied and followed by amendment of life.</dd>
    <dd>2) A change of mind, or a conversion from sin to God (2nd Corinthians 7:9).</dd>
    <dd>3) The relinquishment of any practice, from conviction that it has offended God.</dd>
    <dt>Reprobate</dt>
    <dd>1) Not enduring proof or trial; not of standard purity or fineness; disallowed; rejected. Jeremiah 6.</dd>
    <dd>2) Abandoned in sin; lost to virtue or grace. Titus 1.</dd>
    <dd>3)  Abandoned to error, or in apostasy. 2nd Timothy 3.</dd>
    <dt>Reprove</dt>
    <dd>1) To blame; to censure. Psalm 50.</dd>
    <dd>2) To charge with a fault to the face; to chide; to reprehend. Luke 3.</dd>
    <dd>3) To convince of a fault, or to make it manifest. John 16.</dd>
    <dt>Requite</dt>
    <dd>1) To repay either good or evil; in a good sense, to recompense; to return an equivalent in good; to reward.</dd>
    <dd>2) To do or give in return.</dd>
    <dt>Respite</dt>
    <dd>A putting off of that which was appointed; a postponement or delay. Temporary intermission of labor, or of any process or operation; interval of rest; pause; delay.</dd>
    <dt>Revelation</dt>
    <dd>1) The act of disclosing or discovering to others what was before unknown to them; appropriately, the disclosure or communication of truth to men by God himself, or by his authorized agents, the prophets and apostles. Ephesians 3; 2nd Corinthians 12.</dd>
    <dd>2) That which is revealed; appropriately, the sacred truths which God has communicated to man for his instruction and direction. The revelations of God are contained in the Old and New Testament.</dd>
    <dt>Revile</dt>
    <dd>To reproach; to treat with opprobrious and contemptuous language.</dd>
    <dt>Roe, or Roebuck</dt>
    <dd>A species of deer, the Cervus capreolus, with erect cylindrical branched horns, forked at the summit. This is one of the smallest of the cervine genus, but of elegant shape and remarkably nimble. It prefers a mountainous country, and herds in families.</dd>
