  <p><span class="bold">Cherub, or Cherubim</span> - A figure composed of various creatures, as a man, an ox, an eagle or lion. The first mention of cherubs is in Genesis 3:24, where the figure is not described, but their office was, with a flaming sword, to keep or guard the way of the tree of life. The two cherubs which Moses was commanded to make at the ends of the Mercy seat, were to be of beaten work of gold; and their wings were to extend over the Mercy seat, their faces toward each other, and between them was the residence of the Deity. Exodus 15. The cherubs, in Ezekiel's vision, had each four heads or faces, the hands of a man and wings. The four faces were, the face of a bull, that of a man, that of a lion, and that of an eagle. They had the likeness of a man. Ezekiel 4, and 10. In 2nd Samuel 22:11, and Psalm 18, Yahweh is represented as riding on a cherub, and flying on the wings of the wind. In the celestial hierarchy, cherubs are represented as spirits next in order to seraphs. The hieroglyphical and emblematical figures embroidered on the veils of the tabernacle are called cherubs of curious or skillful work. Exodus 26.</p>
