Furthermore, a grove can be a place deemed holy or designed for worship. In the Scriptures, groves are often viewed as places the people deemed holy, even though God did not declare the place holy. For this reason, certain groves were to be destroyed, as they were places for idol worship. Deuteronomy 16:21-22; Judges 6:25; 2nd Kings 17:16.</dd>
