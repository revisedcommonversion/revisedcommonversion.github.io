  <h3>D</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Degrees</dt>
    <dd>Elevation, i.e. the act; specifically a climactic progression (in certain Psalms) — things that come up, (high) degree, deal, go up, stair, step, story.</dd>
    <dt>Denarius, or Denarii</dt>
    <dd>A Roman silver coin of the value of about fourteen cents; the penny of the New Testament; — so called from being worth originally ten of the pieces called as.</dd>
    <dt>Depose</dt>
    <dd>To remove from a throne or other high station; to dethrone; to divest or deprive of office.</dd>
    <dt>Deputed, or Depute</dt>
    <dd>To appoint as a substitute or agent to act for another; to appoint and send with a special commission or authority to transact business in another's name. The sheriff deputes a man to serve a writ. 2nd Samuel 15.</dd>
    <dt>Dereliction</dt>
    <dd>The act of leaving with an intention not to reclaim; an utter forsaking; abandonment.</dd>
    <dt>Diffidence</dt>
    <dd>More generally, distrust of ones self; want of confidence in our own power, competency, correctness or wisdom; a doubt respecting some personal qualification. We speak or write with diffidence, when we doubt our ability to speak or write correctly or to the satisfaction of others. The effect of diffidence is some degree of reserve, modesty, timidity or bashfulness.</dd>
    <dt>Dispensation</dt>
    <dd>That which is dispensed, dealt out, or appointed; that which is enjoined or bestowed; especially (Theol.), a system of principles, promises, and rules ordained and administered; scheme; economy; as, the Patriarchal, Mosaic, and Christian dispensations.</dd>
    <dt>Disposed</dt>
    <dd>Set in order; arranged; placed; adjusted; applied; bestowed; inclined.</dd>
    <dt>Dispossess</dt>
    <dd>To put out of possession, by any means; to deprive of the actual occupancy of a thing, particularly of land or real estate; to deseize.</dd>
    <dt>Dissension</dt>
    <dd>Disagreement in opinion, usually a disagreement which is violent, producing warm debates or angry words; contention in words; strife; discord; quarrel; breach of friendship and union.</dd>
    <dt>Dissimulation</dt>
    <dd>The act of dissembling; a hiding under a false appearance; a feigning; false pretension; hypocrisy. Dissimulation may be simply concealment of the opinions, sentiments or purpose; but it includes also the assuming of a false or counterfeit appearance which conceals the real opinions or purpose. Romans 12:9.</dd>
    <dt>Distaff</dt>
    <dd>The staff of a spinning-wheel, to which a bunch of flax or tow is tied, and from which the thread is drawn. Proverbs 31.</dd>

    <dd>In a general sense, whatever is taught. Hence, a principle or position in any science; whatever is laid down as true by an instructor or master. The doctrines of the gospel are the principles or truths taught by Christ and his apostles. The doctrines of Plato are the principles which he taught. Hence a doctrine may be true or false; it may be a mere tenet or opinion.</dd>
    <dt>Dowry</dt>
    <dd>The gift of a husband for a wife. Endowment; gift.</dd>

It has four callous protuberances on the fore legs, and two on the hind ones. It is a common beast of burden in Egypt, Syria, and the neighboring countries.</dd>
