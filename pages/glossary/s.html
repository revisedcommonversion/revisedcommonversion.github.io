  <h3>S</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>Sabaoth</dt>
    <dd>This is a Hebrew transliterated word which is the plural form of army or host. It is found in Romans 9:29 and James 5:4 where it is used as "Lord of Sabaoth." The passage in Romans 9 is a quote from Isaiah 1:9, where the English is translated as, "Lord of Hosts." Paul quoted Isaiah from the Septuagint for that passage, which also used the word, "Sabaoth."</dd>
    <dt>Sacrilege</dt>
    <dd>This term is used in Romans 2:22 to refer to those who commit sacrilege. In this case, to commit sacrilege is to rob a temple, or to be a temple-robber.</dd>
    <dt>Saint</dt>
    <dd>Any person who is sanctified by the grace of God, that is, sanctified by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Any member of the body of Christ, or the Church, is considered a saint.</dd>
    <dt>Salvation</dt>
    <dd>1) The act of saving; preservation from destruction, danger or great calamity.</dd>
    <dd>2) Appropriately in theology, the redemption of man from the bondage of sin and liability to eternal death, and the conferring on him everlasting happiness. This is the great salvation. <a href="../gospel.html">How do you receive salvation?</a></dd>
    <dd>3) Deliverance from enemies; victory. Exodus 14.</dd>
    <dd>4) Remission of sins, or saving graces. Luke 19.</dd>
    <dt>Schism</dt>
    <dd>In a general sense, division or separation; but appropriately, a division or separation in a church or denomination of Christians, occasioned by diversity of opinions; breach of unity among people of the same religious faith. In Scripture, the word seems to denote a breach of charity, rather than a difference of doctrine.</dd>
    <dt>School-master</dt>
    <dd>This word is used in 1st Corinthians 4:15 and Galatians 3:24-25. A school-master is a male teacher at a school. This translation comes from the Greek word, <span class="gr-heb">παιδαγωγους</span>, paidagogos (pahee-dag-o-gos'), which literally means, boy leader. These were slaves whose job was to lead boys to school.</dd>
    <dt>Scrabble</dt>
    <dd>To scrape, paw, or scratch with the hands; to proceed by clawing with the hands and feet; to make marks, as if scribbling something.</dd>
    <dt>Sea</dt>
    <dd>A large basin, cistern or laver which Solomon made in the temple, so large as to contain more than six thousand gallons. This was called the brazen sea, and used to hold water for the priests to wash themselves. 1st Kings 7; 2nd Chronicles 4.</dd>
    <dt>Seethe</dt>
    <dd>To boil; to decoct or prepare for food in hot liquor; as, to seethe flesh.</dd>
    <dt>Sedition</dt>
    <dd>The raising of commotion in a state, not amounting to insurrection; conduct tending to treason, but without an overt act; excitement of discontent against the government, or of resistance to lawful authority.</dd>
    <dt>Selah</dt>
    <dd>Suspension (of music), i.e. pause. From Matthew Henry's commentary: "Some refer it to the music with which, in David's time, the psalms were sung; others to the sense, and that it is a note commanding a solemn pause. Selah—Mark that, or, 'Stop there, and consider a little.'"</dd>
    <dt>Selvage</dt>
    <dd>The edge of a cloth, where it is closed by complication the threads; a woven border, or border of the close works.</dd>
    <dt>Sepulcher</dt>
    <dd>A grave; a tomb; the place in which a dead body of a human being is interred, or a place destined for that purpose. Among the Jews sepulchers were often excavations in rocks.</dd>
    <dt>Shahar</dt>
    <dd>Dawn (literal, figurative or adverbial) — day or dayspring, early, light, morning, whence rises.</dd>
    <dt>Share</dt>
    <dd>The part (usually an iron or steel plate) of a plow which cuts the ground at the bottom of a furrow; a plowshare.</dd>
    <dt>Shekel</dt>
    <dd>An ancient weight and coin used by the Jews and by other nations of the same stock. It is difficult to determine the worth of a shekel of ancient Israel, since it's based on the value of gold and silver, which constantly changes. Some Bible translations make an attempt to give a current estimate; however, those estimates will not always be accurate.</dd>
    <dt>Sheminith</dt>
    <dd>Probably an eight-stringed lyre.</dd>
    <dt>Shiggaion, or Shigionoth</dt>
    <dd>aberration, i.e. (technically) a dithyramb or rambling poem — Shiggaion, Shigionoth. From Matthew Henry's commentary: "Shiggaion is a song or psalm (the word is used so only [in Psalm 7:1] and Habakkuk 3:1)—a wandering song (so some), the matter and composition of the several parts being different, but artificially put together—a charming song (so others), very delightful."</dd>
    <dt>Shoshannim</dt>
    <dd>A lily (from its whiteness), as a flower of arch. ornament; also a (straight) trumpet (from the tubular shape).</dd>
    <dt>Shushan-Eduth</dt>
    <dd>Lily (or trumpet) of assemblage; Shushan-Eduth or Shoshannim-Eduth, the title of a popular song — Shoshannim-Eduth, Shushan-eduth.</dd>
    <dt>Sin</dt>
    <dd>1) Sin is a transgression of God's law. 1st John 3:4.</dd>
    <dd>2)  The voluntary departure of a moral agent from a known rule of rectitude or duty, prescribed by God; any voluntary transgression of the divine law, or violation of a divine command; a wicked act; iniquity. Sin is either a positive act in which a known divine law is violated, or it is the voluntary neglect to obey a positive divine command, or a rule of duty clearly implied in such command. Sin comprehends not action only, but neglect of known duty, all evil thoughts purposes, words and desires, whatever is contrary to God's commands or law.</dd>
    <dt>Sluice</dt>
    <dd>An artificial passage for water, fitted with a valve or gate, as in a mill stream, for stopping or regulating the flow; also, a water gate of flood gate.</dd>
    <dt>Smith</dt>
    <dd>One who forges with the hammer; one who works in metals; as, a blacksmith, goldsmith, silversmith, and the like.</dd>
    <dt>Sport</dt>
    <dd>1) That which diverts and makes merry; play; game; diversion; also, mirth. The word signifies both the cause and the effect; that which produces mirth, and the mirth or merriment produced.</dd>
    <dd>2) Mock; mockery; contemptuous mirth.</dd>
    <dd>3) Play; idle jingle.</dd>
    <dd>4) To play; to frolic; to wanton.</dd>
    <dt>Stay (noun)</dt>
    <dd>Prop; support.</dd>
    <dt>Surfeit</dt>
    <dd>To feed with meat or drink, so as to oppress the stomach and derange the functions of the system; to over feed and produce sickness or uneasiness.</dd>
    <dt>Supplication</dt>
    <dd>1) Entreaty; humble and earnest prayer in worship. In all our supplications to the Father of mercies, let us remember a world lying in ignorance and wickedness.</dd>
    <dd>2) Petition; earnest request.</dd>
    <dt>Synagogue</dt>
    <dd>A congregation or assembly of Jews, met for the purpose of worship or the performance of religious rites.</dd>
