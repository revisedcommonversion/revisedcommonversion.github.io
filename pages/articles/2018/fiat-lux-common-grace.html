  <h3>Genesis 1:3 - Fiat Lux and Common Grace</h3>
  <p>Published: Aug 30, 2018</p>
  
  <!-- article text -->
  <p>"And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light." Fiat lux is a Latin phrase for, "Let there be light." When God created the light he established one form of his common grace. Common grace is a term used to describe the blessings God bestows upon every person on Earth, whether a believer or not. Such blessings include, but are not limited to, sunlight and its many benefits, air to breathe, and rain for water. In <a href="../../../text/matthew/ch5.html">Matthew 5:45</a>, Christ spoke of this common grace by saying, "For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust." Believer: When was the last time you gave God praise for His common grace given not only to you, but also your neighbor. If you are to love your neighbor (<a href="../../../text/matthew/ch22.html">Matthew 22:39</a>), then let your faith show itself (<a href="../../../text/james/ch2.html">James 2:17</a>) by praising God for blessing your neighbor; then bless your neighbor with the love of God. Unbeliever: May His common grace be the still small voice (<a href="../../../text/1kings/ch19.html">1st Kings 19:12</a>) that speaks to you of His saving grace, for by grace you are saved, through faith (<a href="../../../text/ephesians/ch2.html">Ephesians 2:8</a>) in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.</p>
