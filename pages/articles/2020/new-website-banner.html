  <h3>The RCV Website Has a New Banner</h3>
  <p>Published: Thu, 12 Mar 2020</p>
  
  <!-- article text -->
  <p>I have had an idea for some time to update the banner area at the top of each page of the RCV website. Up until this point, the banner area has been quite minimalist. It conveyed the proper information and it scaled properly across any device that accessed the website. However, I've been wanting something that stands out just a little more and maybe introduced an element of dynamics to the RCV website. Yesterday, I had the new banner go live, and I think it accomplishes what I had wanted for the banner are of the RCV website.</p>
  <p>The first thing you'll likely notice about the banner is the text behind the logo and site title. This text is the blessing God gave to Moses to bless the people of Israel in <a href="../../../text/numbers/ch6.html">Numbers 6:24-26</a>. The blessing reads as follows:</p>
  <p class="center">May the LORD bless you and keep you.</p>
  <p class="center">May the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.</p>
  <p class="center">May the LORD lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.</p>
  <p>That is my prayer for every reader of the RCV and every visitor of this website.</p>
  <p>Now, on the technical side, this new banner adds a touch of dynamics to the RCV website. It features a technique known as parallax scrolling. That's the effect where the background, that is, text of the prayer, stays in place while the rest of the page content (i.e., the logo, site title, etc.) scrolls over the top of it. Then, when the screen size of the device accessing the website is smaller, such as with a mobile phone, the banner changes to an alternate style that fits better on a wide range of smaller screens. Both styles of banner look good no matter how wide or narrow the viewing screen gets.</p>
  <p>As the text of the RCV matures and requires less editing, I'm thinking more on how I can visually or functionally improve the RCV experience, both on the website and in the various book formats. I really enjoyed making this banner and I like how it makes the RCV website look. Hopefully, you'll agree. Thank you for taking the time to visit the RCV website and read this article.</p>
