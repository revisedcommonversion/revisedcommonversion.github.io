  <h3>A Prayer for Communion</h3>
  <p>Communion is a sacred act that should be observed by all Christians. It is the time for the believer to reflect upon the price Christ paid by dying on the cross. It symbolizes Christ's body, which was given for each believer, and the blood He shed for the forgiveness of sins.</p><p>Contrary to what some may believe, communion does not have to be observed in a church. In fact, you can observe it at home whenever you wish. You only need a couple of items and a little bit of time for prayer.</p>
  <p>You will need these two items:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Something to symbolize the body. It is common to use the small, hexagonal or round, oyster crackers you can purchase at the grocery store for a couple or few dollars. I use unsalted saltine crackers.</li>
    <li>Something to symbolize the blood. Grape juice is most commonly used.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A note to make here is that communion is not meant to focus on these items. These are merely items to simulate the last supper. You may use other items. Communion is an inward expression of Christians to examine themselves and to memorialize the crucifixion of Christ and its purpose in His ministry.</p>
  <p>Finally, you need to enter a moment of prayer to observe communion. Below is a sample prayer that you may use to observe communion on your own.</p>
  <h4>The Prayer:</h4>
  <p>Gracious and merciful Father, who is in Heaven, I come to You in the name of Jesus. Name above all names, You are worthy to be praised. To You I lift up my eyes, to you who dwell in the heavens. I give You praise, Lord of hosts, for You are good and Your mercy endures forever.</p>
  <p>Your word says that I must forgive the trespasses against me. Now, since You have forgiven my sins, I must forgive my brothers and sisters, not until seven times, but until seventy times seven.</p>
  <p>I come in prayer to examine myself and to eat of this bread and drink of this cup.</p>
  <p>Lord, I take this bread and give You thanks. Concerning this bread, You said, "Take, eat. This is My body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of Me." This bread symbolizes Your body, which bore my sins as You hung on the cross, that I, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness. By Your stripes I was healed.</p>
  <p>[Eat whatever you used to symbolize the body.]</p>
  <p>Concerning this cup, You said, "This is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sin." I thank You that You are the One who offers redemption through Your blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of Your grace. For it was You who offered Yourself as the one sacrifice for sins forever, and afterward sat down at the right hand of God.</p>
  <p>[Drink whatever you used to symbolize the blood.]</p>
  <p>As often as I eat this bread and drink this cup, I proclaim Christ's death until He comes. Blessed is Your glorious name forever. Let the whole earth be filled with Your glory. Amen, and amen. For Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.</p>
