  <h3>Christmas in the Scriptures</h3>
  <p class="it">Long ago, before Christ was born...</p>
  <p>...The Lord himself will give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14)... For to us a child is born, to us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6)... But you, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you he shall come forth to me who is to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting (Micah 5:2).</p>
  <p class="it">And then the Savior was born...</p>
  <p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: when his mother, Mary, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take for yourself Mary as your wife. For that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their sins." Now all this was done, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which being interpreted is, "God with us." Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took for himself his wife, and did not know her until she had brought forth her first-born son. And he called his name JESUS.</p>
  <p class="it">[Matthew 1:18-25]</p>
  <p>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed, each into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and lineage of David), to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should deliver. And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the guest-chamber.</p>
  <p>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were in great fear. And the angel said to them, "Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be for all people. For there is born to you this day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign for you: you shall find the baby wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</p>
  <p>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men."</p>
  <p>And it came to pass, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us." (And behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.)* And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told to them concerning this child. And all those who heard it, wondered at those things which were told to them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them...</p>
  <p>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom. And the grace of God was upon him.</p>
