  <title>The Holy Bible: Revised Common Version</title>
  <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com.com</link>
  <description>A modern Bible revision of a classic Bible text. The Revised Common Version (RCV) is a derivative work of Noah Webster's 1833 Common Version of the Bible (a revision of the King James Version). As with Webster's Common Version, the RCV aims to make updates to words and phrases so that they are better understood by the everyday reader who may not read the scriptures with the aid of commentaries. Care has been taken so that changes to the text are not theologically motivated, but rather are consistent with the original text. Changes include the updating of archaic words to the current equivalent, rearranging of sentences to better follow current English, adjusting of punctuation to aid the reader in the flow of reading, addition of quotation marks, notation of Old Testament quotes in the New Testament, and an outline for each chapter. Digital versions of the RCV have the words of Christ in blue.</description>

    <title>The RCV Project is Celebrating Its Tenth Anniversary</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/tenth-anniversary.html</link>
    <description>Ten years ago this month, back in September 2008, I officially began work on the project that would become the Revised Common Version. I had actually attempted the work two previous times, but was completely unsatisfied with the way they started that I just completely scrapped them and began anew. They say the third time is the charm, and the case was so with the RCV. Fast forward ten years and you have the project as it is today, and I must say that I am quite satisfied with how it has turned out...</description>

    <title>The RCV Website Has a New Banner</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/new-website-banner.html</link>
    <description>I have had an idea for some time to update the banner area at the top of each page of the RCV website. Up until this point, the banner area has been quite minimalist. It conveyed the proper information and it scaled properly across any device that accessed the website. However, I've been wanting something that stands out just a little more and maybe introduced an element of dynamics to the RCV website. Yesterday, I had the new banner go live, and I think it accomplishes what I had wanted for the banner are of the RCV website....</description>
