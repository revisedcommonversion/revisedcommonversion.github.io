  <title>The Holy Bible: Revised Common Version</title>
  <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com</link>
  <description>A modern Bible revision of a classic Bible text. The Revised Common Version (RCV) is a derivative work of Noah Webster's 1833 Common Version of the Bible (a revision of the King James Version). As with Webster's Common Version, the RCV aims to make updates to words and phrases so that they are better understood by the everyday reader who may not read the scriptures with the aid of commentaries. Care has been taken so that changes to the text are not theologically motivated, but rather are consistent with the original text. Changes include the updating of archaic words to the current equivalent, rearranging of sentences to better follow current English, adjusting of punctuation to aid the reader in the flow of reading, addition of quotation marks, notation of Old Testament quotes in the New Testament, and an outline for each chapter. Digital versions of the RCV have the words of Christ in blue.</description>

    <description>I am pleased to announce the release of a new print edition of the RCV, r2409. This print release didn't have anything particularly exciting to it other than readability updates throughout the entirety of the text. However, in this release, I did put extra effort into these specific books of the Bible: Genesis, the Minor Prophets, Matthew, Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews....</description>

    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2024/new-formatting-feature-lines-poetry-distinguished.html</link>
    <description>In this article, I'd like to take a moment to highlight a new formatting feature of the RCV. Over the past ten years (yes, this has been in the works for quite a while) I have been trying to figure out the best way to display lines of poetry in the Scripture text. Well, I finally figured it out....</description>

    <title>Errata: 2nd Corinthians 9:10</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2023/errata-2corinthians-9-10.html</link>
    <description>There is an erratum that has been identified and is in the process of being addressed. It has already been fixed on the website, and will be fixed in the digital versions of the RCV soon to be released (within the next day or two). It will also be fixed in the next regulary scheduled print version sometime next month. The verse, 2nd Corinthians 9:10, has a portion of the text that was mistakenly removed at some point in the past 15 years of editing. This particular portion of the verse contains an Old Testament quote, so it is of extra significance....</description>

    <description>With the recently released r2307 edition of the RCV, I made a couple major changes. The first change, outlined in this article, is probably the least exciting, but it marks a major shift in how the text of the RCV can be used....</description>

    <title>The Extra Text of Job from the Greek Septuagint</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2023/extra-text-job-septuagint.html</link>
    <description>I have been doing a lot of reading from the Greek Septuagint lately, and I always seem to find something interesting during my reading sessions. But this time, I was reminded by my wife, who was asking me some questions about Job while reading one of her books, that there is a small, additional paragraph appended to the end of Job in the Septuagint. This extra text is appended to Job 42:17, and it gives some historical information about Job. The authenticity of this text is not certain, but I'll provide a few points of view on the matter after I provide the text below....</description>

    <title>The Extra Text of Esther from the Greek Septuagint</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2021/extra-text-esther-septuagint.html</link>
    <description>I can honestly say that I have never read the text of the Apocrypha. I've always been curious about it, but never took the time to read any of the text. I decided to start with the shorter works in the Apocrypha as a sort of sample of the text. One of the shorter works is some extra text found in the Story of Esther. I was immediately fascinated by this extra text in Esther as it provided more details and extended accounts of portions ofher....</description>

    <title>Psalm 151 From the Septuagint</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2021/psalm-151-from-septuagint.html</link>
    <description>Some time ago, I pulled my copy of the Septuagint off my bookshelf and began to peruse it. I don't recall why I was reading the Septuagint. Most likely, I was either wanting to get a different take on a passage for clarity, or I was reading an alternate translation of a passage. What caught my eye is that there was an extra bit of text after the 150th Psalm. Below is that text, which is an unofficial 151st Psalm. It wasn't numbered in my copy of the Septuagint, but I'm just going to refer to it as Psalm 151. As you read this text, try to think about one detail of the story David leaves out....</description>

    <title>The RCV Website Has a New Banner</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2020/new-website-banner.html</link>
    <description>I have had an idea for some time to update the banner area at the top of each page of the RCV website. Up until this point, the banner area has been quite minimalist. It conveyed the proper information and it scaled properly across any device that accessed the website. However, I've been wanting something that stands out just a little more and maybe introduced an element of dynamics to the RCV website. Yesterday, I had the new banner go live, and I think it accomplishes what I had wanted for the banner are of the RCV website....</description>

    <title>The RCV Project is Celebrating Its Tenth Anniversary</title>
    <link>https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/pages/articles/2018/tenth-anniversary.html</link>
    <description>Ten years ago this month, back in September 2008, I officially began work on the project that would become the Revised Common Version. I had actually attempted the work two previous times, but was completely unsatisfied with the way they started that I just completely scrapped them and began anew. They say the third time is the charm, and the case was so with the RCV. Fast forward ten years and you have the project as it is today, and I must say that I am quite satisfied with how it has turned out...</description>
