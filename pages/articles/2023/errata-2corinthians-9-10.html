  <!-- article text -->
<p>There is an erratum that has been identified and is in the process of being addressed. It has already been fixed on the website, and will be fixed in the digital versions of the RCV soon to be released (within the next day or two). It will also be fixed in the next regulary scheduled print version sometime next month. The verse, 2nd Corinthians 9:10, has a portion of the text that was mistakenly removed at some point in the past 15 years of editing. This particular portion of the verse contains an Old Testament quote, so it is of extra significance.</p>
<p>Below is a before and after comparison of the verse showing the missing portion.</p>
<p>The verse with the error:</p>
<blockquote>Now may he who ministers seed to the sower supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</blockquote>
<p>The corrected verse:</p>
<blockquote>Now may he who supplies "<cite>seed to the sower and bread for food,</cite>" supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase "<cite>the fruits of your righteousness,</cite>"</blockquote>
