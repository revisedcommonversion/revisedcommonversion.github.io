  <meta name="description" content="A modern Bible revision of a classic Bible text. The Revised Common Version (RCV) is a derivative work of Noah Webster's 1833 Common Version of the Bible (a revision of the King James Version). As with Webster's Common Version, the RCV aims to make updates to words and phrases so that they are better understood by the everyday reader who may not read the scriptures with the aid of commentaries. Care has been taken so that changes to the text are not theologically motivated, but rather are consistent with the original text. Changes include the updating of archaic words to the current equivalent, rearranging of sentences to better follow current English, adjusting of punctuation to aid the reader in the flow of reading, and addition of quotation marks." />

  <h3>Parable of the Lost Page</h3>
  <p>What man of you having one hundred web pages, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine on the server and go after that which is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he clicks on its link, rejoicing. And when he logs on to his email service, he sends a message to his friends and neighbors, saying to them, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the page which was lost."</p>
  <p style="text-align:right;">&mdash;Inspired by <a href="https://www.revisedcommonversion.com/text/luke/ch15.html">Luke 15:4-6</a></p>
