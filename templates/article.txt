<p>I am pleased to announce the release of a new print edition of the RCV, r2409. This print release didn't have anything particularly exciting to it other than readability updates throughout the entirety of the text. However, in this release, I did put extra effort into these specific books of the Bible: Genesis, the Minor Prophets, Matthew, Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews. All of these books are at the point where I can say that general edits are essentially 100% complete. There may still be some technical edits to be discovered at a later time, but fo now, I'm turning my attention to other books until the next print release.</p>
<p>As always, I thank you for your interest and readership of the RCV. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are always welcome.</p>
