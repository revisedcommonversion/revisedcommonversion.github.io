<p>Today, I am announcing the release of a new edition of the RCV. This is the r2209 edition. This edition contains numerous updates spanning the entirety of the text of the RCV. These edits were mostly minor errata and readability updates.</p>

<p>This edition will include all digital files available on the <a href="../download.html">Download</a> page and the eBook version available on the <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/william-masopust/the-holy-bible-revised-common-version-ebook/ebook/product-pv6e7q.html" target="_blank">Lulu book store</a>. This edition also applies to the print version of the RCV found on the <a href="../purchase.html">Purchase</a> page.</p>

<p>I also have to mention some unfortunate news that comes with this release. I will no longer be able to offer the RCV on the Amazon Kindle store. This is due to a disagreement I have with Amazon over the publishing rights of the RCV. I hate that it has come to this, but Amazon has no interest in keeping the RCV available on the Kindle Store. To be honest, I was not surprised. You can still obtain a free Kindle version of the RCV on the Download page.</p>

<p>Thank you for your taking the time to read the RCV, and as always, if you have any questions, comments, or feedback of any kind, please feel free to send me an email to the address listed on the Home page. I always welcome and value reader feedback. Again, thank you.</p>
