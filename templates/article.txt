  <p>There is an erratum that has been addressed in the print versions of the RCV. The verse Isaiah 11:4 contains a typographical error where a comma was to be ommitted, but the last letter of the preceding word was mistakenly deleted. The typo admittedly creates an awkward reading of the text. The error has been fixed and new print files have been submitted for future publishing. I apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
