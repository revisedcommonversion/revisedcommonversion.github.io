  <p>After 11 years of the RCV project, I have decided to give the logo a little bit of an update. The main reason for the update to the logo is that I wanted to try and balance out the various elements in the logo. Looking at the before and after images below, you can see how a simple font adjustment balanced the "RCV" in the logo. Then, I also thickened the cross a little so that it didn't look too thin compared to the new font. Here are the before and after images.</p>
  <p class="bold">Before:</p>
  <div class="center"><img src="../../images/rcv-logo-old-152.png" alt="Former RCV Logo" /></div>
  <p class="bold">After:</p>
  <div class="center"><img src="../../images/rcv-logo-152.png" alt="New RCV Logo" /></div>
  <p>Digital editions of the RCV have been updated with the new logo. Print editions will be updated with the new logo when they are released during the next print edition update in September 2020.</p>
