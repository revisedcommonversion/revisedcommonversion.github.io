  <p>Today, I am announcing the release of a new edition of the RCV. This is the r1909 edition. This edition contains numerous updates spanning the entirety of the text of the RCV. These edits were mostly minor errata and some readability updates.</p>
  <p>This edition will include all digital files available on the <a href="../download.html">Download</a> page and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GWPCGG/">Kindle edition</a> on the Amazon Kindle book store. This edition also applies to the print version of the RCV found on the <a href="../purchase.html">Purchase</a> page.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your taking the time to read the RCV, and as always, if you have any questions, comments, or feedback of any kind, please feel free to send me an email to the address listed on the <a href="../../index.html">Home</a> page. I always welcome and value reader feedback. Again, thank you.</p>
