<p>Today, I am announcing the release of a new edition of the RCV. This is the r2211 edition. This edition contains numerous updates spanning the entirety of the text of the RCV. These edits were mostly minor errata and readability updates. Furthermore, many edits were made to the front matter and the Gospel message, which is what led to me releasing a new print edition along with the digital editions.</p>

<p>This edition will include all digital files available on the <a href="../download.html">Download</a> page and the eBook version available on the <a href="https://www.lulu.com/shop/william-masopust/the-holy-bible-revised-common-version-ebook/ebook/product-pv6e7q.html" target="_blank">Lulu book store</a>. This edition also applies to the print version of the RCV found on the <a href="../purchase.html">Purchase</a> page.</p>

<p>Thank you for your taking the time to read the RCV, and as always, if you have any questions, comments, or feedback of any kind, please feel free to send me an email to the address listed on the Home page. I always welcome and value reader feedback. Again, thank you.</p>
