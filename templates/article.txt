  <p>Today, a new digital edition of the RCV has been released. This is the r1903 edition. This edition contains minor updates to the r1809 edition (Tenth Anniversary Edition). Edits span the entirety of the text of the RCV.</p>
  <p>This edition will include all digital files available on the <a href="../download.html">Download</a> page and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GWPCGG/">Kindle edition</a> on the Amazon Kindle book store. This edition will not be applied to the print version of the RCV. I will wait for the next edition release to update the print version.</p>
  <p>Thank you for your taking the time to read the RCV, and as always, if you have any questions, comments, or feedback of any kind, please feel free to send me an email to the address listed on the <a href="../../index.html">Home</a> page. I always welcome and value reader feedback. Again, thank you.</p>
