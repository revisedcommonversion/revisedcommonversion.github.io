<p>I am pleased to announce the release of a new edition of the RCV, r2512. This release consists of numerous readability updates throughout the entirety of the text. You can see a full list of changes at <a href="http://source.rcv.xyz" target="_blank">http://source.rcv.xyz</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138;]</sup>. There are a couple of things to note for this release.</p>
<p>First, I will be discontinuing the MOBI format available on the Download page. Amazon no longer supports the format and favors either ePub or AZW3 format. I will focus on providing the ePub and PDF digital formats only for now.</p>
<p>Second, and this comes as a bit of not-so-good news, the print version that is released with this new edition may likely be the last print version published. The print version has grown to the point that it has met many formatting constraints. For instance, there are about nine books of the Bible that if I add even one character to the text, it may break the format for the rest of the RCV text. I'm also getting very close to the maximum page limit set by the publisher. So, I'm going to monitor the edits over the next year and limit edits to the print version to only typographical errors or major changes to the text. Since this will cause a forked or split edition for the print version, it will be marked with an Greek character in the revision number, as in r2512α. The print version will remain based on the r2512 edition of the text, but with select edits from newer editions if necessary.</p>
<p>As always, I thank you for your interest and readership of the RCV. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are always welcome.</p>
