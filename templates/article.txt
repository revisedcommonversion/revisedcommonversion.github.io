  <p>I have updated the formatting of the PDF file on the Download page to look like the formatting in the print versions of the RCV found on the Purchase page. In addition to changing the formatting, the PDF has been resized to 8.5x11 inch paper. What this means is that you can now print your own RCV Bible at home. The margins should be deep enough on the spine side of the page that you could punch holes in the pages and put them in a three-ring binder. Furthermore, the odd and even pages should line up properly for two-sided printing, if your printer supports that feature.</p>
  <p>If you decide to give this a try, please feel free to let me know how it looks or send me a picture of your print-your-own RCV Bible.</p>
