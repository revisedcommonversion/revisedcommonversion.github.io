  <p>I have finally made the full text of the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible available for download on the RCV website. You can find it on the Download page along with the RCV and the Webster Bible. By adding the KJV, I now have the complete English lineage of the RCV on the website.</p>
  <p>The reason it has taken me so long to get the KJV on the RCV website is because I haven't found a satisfactory format for providing the text. So, for this download, I have prepared the KJV in plain text format in two different forms. One form contains the full text in a single text file, and the other form is each book of the Bible in a separate text file. Furthermore, I have provided the text of the Apocrypha in a separate text file. All files have been combined in a ZIP archive.</p>
  <p>This text of the KJV has been unmodified and is in the Public Domain, except in countries where the Public Domain does not apply. See the README file in the ZIP archive.</p>
