  <p>A new devotional has been added to the RCV website. I have included Charles Spurgeon's Evening devotional on each day's devotional reading. For instance, when you navigate to the devotional reading for any given day, let's say <a href="../devotional/jan14.html">January 14th</a>, you can read the Morning devotional on Isaiah 63:1 and you can read the Evening devotional on Matthew 14:30 on the same page. I have been wanting to add another devotional to the RCV website for some time now, and I think Spurgeon's Evening devotional is a great fit for the existing Morning devotional. I hope that you will find this added devotional useful. Thank you for your readership.</p>
