<p>Today, I am announcing the release of a new edition of the RCV. This is the r2309 edition. This edition contains numerous updates spanning the entirety of the text of the RCV. These edits were mostly updating archaic and dated words and readability updates. This edition will include all digital files available on the <a href="../../download.html">Download</a> page and the eBook versions available on the <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rcvbible/extras" target="_blank">Buy Me a Coffee store</a><sup class="icon">[&#10138]</sup>. This edition also applies to the print version of the RCV found on the <a href="../../purchase.html">Purchase</a> page.</p>
<p>This edition also marks a significant milestone for the RCV project. With the release of this edition, the RCV project is officially 15 years old. Looking back, a lot has happened with the RCV in 15 years, and I couldn't be happier with the way the project has turned out.</p>
<p>So, what's in store for the future of the RCV? Well, I have a few ideas, but in the very near future, I will make an announcement of a significant study resource to accompany the RCV text. It is essentially finished, but I want a little more time for usability testing. I'm really excited to unveil this resource, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your taking the time to read the RCV. I greatly appreciate your readership and value your feedback.</p>
